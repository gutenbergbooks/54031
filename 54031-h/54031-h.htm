<p class='pindent'>I was botanizing lately in the woods of Luciennes,
with one of my friends, a distinguished Orientalist
and renowned botanist, who had, a few years since,
traveled six thousand miles, and risked his life twenty
times, in order to obtain a handful of plants from the
slopes of the Taurus or the plains of Asia Minor. After
we had wandered for some time through the woods,
gathering here and there some dry grass and orchis,
merely to renew an acquaintance with them, we
lounged toward the handsome village of Gressets
and the delightful valley of Beauregard, directing our
steps toward a breakfast, which we hoped to find
a little further on, when, beneath an alley of lofty
poplars, on the left of the meadows of the Butard,
we saw two persons, a man and a woman, both
young, approaching us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My companion made a gesture of surprise at the
sight of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know those persons?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what class, genus and species are they?” I
used the words merely in their botanical sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Analyze, observe and divine,” replied my illustrious
traveler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I determined then on applying to my individuals,
not the system of Linnæus, but that of Jussien, that
of affinities and analogies. The latter appeared to
me to be more suitable and easier than the former.
The young man was dressed in a very simple and
even negligent style, wearing those high heeled shoes,
three-quarter boots, which have succeeded the half
boots, (boots, since the introduction of comfort among
us, having steadily lessened,) and had not even straps
to his pantaloons. A pearl colored sack, colored
shirt, and traveling cap with a large visor, completed
his costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near him walked a young woman, of the middle
height and finely formed, but with such an air of indolence
in her movements, flexibility of the body, and
jogging of the haunches, as proclaimed a southern
origin or a want of distinction. They advanced
with their heads down, speaking without looking up,
and walking side by side without taking arms, but
from time to time one leant on the shoulder of the
other, with a movement full of affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until we crossed them that I could see
their figures; until then I had been able to study only
their costume and general outline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man blushed on recognizing my companion,
and saluted him with a very humble air; I
had scarcely time, however, to catch a single pathognomic
line of his face. The female was very
handsome; the elegance of her neck, the regularity
of her features, gave her a certain air of distinction,
contradicted, however, by something provoking in
her appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had passed on some distance, my
friend said to me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what judgment do you pass on our two
persons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” replied I, positively, “the young man is
your confectioner, who is about to marry his head
shop-girl;” but reading a sign of negation on the
countenance of my interrogator—“or a successful
merchant’s clerk, with a countess without prejudices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked for a moment’s reflection, and, to render
my work of observation perfect, I looked after them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached, near the place where we were,
the side of a spring, called, in the country, the
“Priest’s Fountain.” The young female had already
seated herself upon the grass, and drawing forth a
napkin spread it near her, whilst the young man
drew a paté and some other provisions carefully
from his basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” I said to myself, “there are, evidently,
in the face of this beautiful person, traits both
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
of the great lady and the grisette; but, on thinking
of her rolling fashion of walking, and especially
judging of her by the appearance of her companion,
then stooping to uncork a bottle, and whose unstrapped
pantaloons, riding half way up his leg, revealed
his quarter boots, the grisette type prevailed
in my opinion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lady,” I replied, but with less assurance
than at first, “is a figurante at one of our theatres, or
a female equestrian at the Olympic circus.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is some truth in what you say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a lemonade seller.” I judged so from the
practiced facility with which he appeared to open
the bottle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are farther from the mark than ever,” said
my companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, let us talk about something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once at the Butard we thought no more of our
two Parisian cockneys. Whilst they were preparing
our breakfast, and even whilst we were breakfasting,
my friend naturally recommenced speaking of his
travels in the Taurus and Anti-Taurus, in the Balkan,
the Caucasus, on the banks of the Euphrates,
and then, to give me a respite from all his botanical
and <a id='geo'></a>geological descriptions, he related to me, piece
by piece, without appearing to attach the least importance
to them, a story, which interested me very
much. He had collected the details of it (the
scene of which was laid not far from the shores of
the Black Sea, between Erzerum and Constantinople)
from the lips of one of the principal actors
in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I endeavored to reduce it to writing when with
him, not in the same order, or disorder, as to events,
but at least so far as regards their exactness, and
availing myself of the knowledge of persons and
places acquired by my traveler.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Toward the middle of the month of July, in the
year 1841, in the pachalick of Shivas, in the vast
gardens situated near the Red River, a young girl,
dressed in the Turkish costume, was walking slowly,
with her head bent down, followed by an old negress.
At times she turned her head rapidly, and
when her eyes, through the massive maples and
sycamores, rested on the angle of a large building,
with gilded lattices and balconies of finely carved
cedar, her complexion, usually pale, became suddenly
suffused, her small foot contracted against the
ground, her breast heaved, and she restrained with
difficulty the sigh that endeavored to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silent and pre-occupied she stopped, and with her
finger designated a plantain tree to the negress. The
latter immediately entered an elegant kiosk, a few
paces distant, and returned, bearing the skin of a
tiger, which she placed at the foot of the tree. After
the old negress had passed and repassed several
times from the skin to the kiosk, and from the kiosk
to the skin, the young girl seated herself, cross-legged,
on the latter, leaning against the plantain tree, on a
cushion of black velvet, holding carelessly in her
left hand an ornamented pipe, with a tube of Persian
cherry, and in her right, in a small stand of filagreed
gold, shaped like an egg-cup, a slight porcelain cup,
which the old slave replenished from time to time
with the fragrant Mocha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla was seventeen years old; her black and
lustrous hair, parted over her temples, resembled the
raven’s wing; her eye-brows thin, and forming a
perfect arch, though of the same color as her hair,
were, as well as her long eye-lashes and the edge of
the lids, covered with a preparation of antimony,
called <span class='it'>sourmah</span>. Still other colors had been employed
to heighten the lustre of her beauty; the carnation
of her lips had disappeared beneath a light
touch of indigo; and, by way of contrary effect, beneath
her eyes, where the fine net work of her veins
naturally produced a light blue tint, the purple of the
henna shone out. The henna, a kind of vegetable
carmine, much used in the east, also blushed upon
the nails of her hands and feet, and even upon her
heels, which peeped out, naked, from her small,
beautiful sandals, embroidered with gold and pearls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though thus tattooed, in the Asiatic fashion, Baïla
was none the less beautiful. Her costume consisted
simply of a velvet caftan, muslin pantaloons, embroidered
with silver, and a cashmere girdle; but
all the knicknackeries of Oriental luxuriousness were
displayed in her toilet. The double row of sequins
which swung on her head, the large golden bracelets
which covered her arms and graced her ankles, the
chains, the precious stones which shone on her
hands and her corsage, and which shook on the extremities
of her long flowing hair and glittered on
her very pipe stem, graced in a singular manner her
youthful charms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The better to understand what kind of astonished
admiration her appearance might at this time produce,
we should add that of the old black slave, who,
from her age as well as color, her short, thick figure,
her dull and heavy look, formed so striking a contrast
with the fresh beauty of Baïla, her fine and
supple figure and her glance, still lively and penetrating,
notwithstanding the deep thought which
then half veiled it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The better to lighten up this picture we must suspend
over the heads of these two females, so dissimilar,
the beautiful blue sky of Asia, and describe
some incidents of the land, some singularities of the
local vegetation which surrounded them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some paces in advance of the plantain against
which Baïla was reclining, was a small circular
basin of Cipolin marble, from which sprang a jet, in
the form of a sheaf, causing a delicious freshness to
reign around. A little farther on were two palm
trees, which, springing up on either hand and mingling
their tops, presented the appearance of two
columns, forming an arcade of verdure. But before
this entrance, judging from appearances, the shadow
even of a man should never appear. Baïla belonged
to a jealous master; her beauty, heightened by so
much art and coquetry, was to grow, blossom and
flower for him alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the foot of the palm trees parted a double
hedge of purple beeches, of silvery willows, of nopals
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
of strange forms with saffron tints, and of various
shrubs with their many colored flowers and
fruits. The dog-shades, with their stars of violet
colored velvet, the night-shades, with their scarlet
clusters involved amidst the <a id='mim'></a>mimosas, out of which
sprang the golden features of the cassia. Mingling
their branches with the lower branches of the plantain,
the mangroves hung like garlands above the
head of Baïla, their large leaves hollowed into cups,
and so strangely bordered with flowers and fruits of
orange color mixed with crimson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Farther back, behind the plantain, on a reddish,
sandy spot, grew large numbers of the ice plant, presenting
to the deceived vision the appearance of
plants caught by the frost during the winter in our
northern climes, and the glass work covered the
ground with crystalized plates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture was soon to become animated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The magnificent eastern sun, sinking toward the
horizon and throwing his last flames beneath the
verdant pediment of the palm trees, caused the earth
to sparkle as if covered with diamonds. His rays,
broken by the glittering sheaf in the basin, spread
across those masses of flower and foliage, rainbows,
superb in golden and violet tints; they flashed from
the plantain to the variegated cups of the mangrove,
and lighted up the whole form of Baïla, from her
brow, crowned with sequins, to her spangled slippers;
they even mingled with the smoke of her narghila,
and with the vapor of the Mocha, which
arose like a perfume from the porcelain cup, and
glistening on the skin of the tiger on which she was
seated, appeared to roll about in small vague circles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the night breeze, rising, gently agitated the
flowers and the herbage, mingling in soft harmony
all those zones of light and shade, was it not a subject
of regret that a human eye could not gaze upon
the beautiful odalisk, in the midst of those magical
illusions, shining in the triple splendor of her jewels,
her youth, and her beauty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, yet, a man was to enjoy this bewitching
scene, and that man not her master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mariam, the old negress, was asleep at the foot of
the tree, holding in her hands the small mortar in
which she had bruised the coffee to supply the demands
of her mistress. Baïla, half dozing, was
holding out, mechanically, toward her the china
cup, when a man suddenly appeared between the
two palm trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sight of him the odalisk at first thought she
was dreaming; then, restrained by a feeling, perhaps
of alarm, perhaps of curiosity, remained quiet,
immovable, without speaking—only the cup which
she held fell from her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger, who was a young Frank, having
first made a motion as of flight, became emboldened
and approached her, with a heightened color and
trembling lips, arising from a too lively emotion or
from an excess of prudence on account of the negress.
He merely inquired from Baïla the way to
the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He expressed himself very well in Turkish; she
did not appear, however, to understand him. What!
a stranger, eluding the vigilance of guards, had crossed
the double circuit of the gardens which enclosed her—had
braved death—merely to ask his way!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Restored to a feeling of her situation, she rose,
with an offended air, drew from her girdle a
small dagger, ornamented with diamonds—a plaything,
rather than offensive or defensive arms—and
made an imperious sign to him to retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man recoiled before the beautiful
slave, with an appearance of contriteness and embarrassment,
but without ceasing to regard her earnestly.
He appeared to be unable to remove his
eyes from the picture which had riveted his attention;
still, however, undecided and muttering confused
words, he was crossing the porch of the palm
trees, when the negress suddenly awoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sight of the shadow of a man, which reached
into the enclosure, she sprang up, uttering a cry of
alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing?” said Baïla, placing herself
before her, doubtless from a feeling of pity toward
the imprudent youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that shadow—do you not see it? It is that
of a man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of a bostangy! Who else would have dared to
enter here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the bostangis should be more careful. Has
not our master prohibited them from entering the
gardens when we are here—when you are here?
A man has entered, I tell you; I saw his shadow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what shadow are you speaking? Stop—look!”
and Baïla stopped before the negress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw it,” repeated the negress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shadow of a tree—yes, that is possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trees do not run, and it appeared to run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been dreaming, my good Mariam,” and
Baïla maintained so well that no one had been
there, that she had seen nothing, but in a dream,
that Mariam submissively feigned to believe her,
and both prepared to return to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were half way there when, on turning an
alley, the negress uttered a new cry, pointing to an
individual who was escaping at full speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I dreaming this time?” she said, and she
was about to call for assistance, when the odalisk,
placing her hand on her mouth, ordered her to keep
silence. Mariam, who was devoted to her mistress,
obeyed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having returned to her apartment, Baïla reflected
on her adventure. Adventures are rare in a harem
life. She was intriguing there desperately, and
would have been disquieted had she not had other
cares. These, in their turn, occupied her thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In thinking of them she became fretful, angry;
she crushed the rich stuffs which lay beside her.
She even wept, but rather from passion than grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the preceding evening Baïla was doubtful of
her beauty; since then she cursed the existence
to which she had been condemned, and regretted the
days of her early youth. To remove from her mind
the incessant idea which tormented her, she essayed
to remount to the past. She found there, if not consolation,
at least distraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
The past of a young girl of seventeen is frequently
but the paradise of memory—a radiant Eden, peopled
with remembrances of her family, and sometimes
of a first love. It was not so with Baïla;
her family were indifferent to her, and her first love
had been imposed upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was born in Mingrelia, of a drunken father
and an avaricious mother. They, finding her face
handsome and her body well proportioned, had destined
her, almost from the cradle, for the pleasures
of the Sultan. Her education had been suitable for
her destined state. She was taught to dance and
sing, and to accompany herself in recitative; nothing
more had ever been thought of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although her parents professed externally one of
the forms of the Christian religion, had they sought
to develop the slightest religious instinct in her?
What was the use of it? The morality of Christ
could but give her false ideas and be entirely useless
to her in the brilliant career which was to open before
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if the beautiful child only awakened toward
herself feelings of speculation, if she was, in the eyes
of her parents, but a piece of precious merchandise,
she, at least, profited in advance by the privileges it
conferred upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst her brothers were unceasingly occupied
with the culture of their vineyard, with the gathering
of grapes and honey—whilst her sister, as beautiful
as herself, but slightly lame, was condemned to
assist her mother in household cares, Baïla led a
life of indolence. Could they allow her white and
delicate hands to come in contact with dirty furnaces,
or her well-turned nails to be bruised against
the heavy earthen ware, or her handsome feet to be
deformed by the stones in the roads? No—it would
have been at the risk of injuring her, and of deteriorating
from her value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, under the paternal roof, where all the rest
were struggling and laboring, she alone, extended in
the shade, having no other occupation than singing
and dancing, passed her life in indolence, or in regarding
with artless admiration the increase and
development of her beauty, the wealth of her family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The common table was covered with coarse food
for the rest; for her, and her alone, are reserved the
most delicate products of fishing and hunting. Her
brothers collected carefully for her those delicate
bulbs, which, reduced to flour, make that marvelous
<span class='it'>salep</span>, at once an internal cosmetic and a nutritive
substance, which the women of the East use to aid
them in the development of their figures, and to give
to their skin a coloring of rosy white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If they were going to any place, Baïla traveled on
the back of a mule, in a dress of silk, whilst the rest
of the family, clothed in coarse wool or serge, escorted
her on foot, watching over her with constant
solicitude. Truly, a stranger meeting them by the
way, and witnessing all these cares and demonstrations,
would have taken her for an idolized daughter,
guarded against destiny by the most tender affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If her father, however, approached her, it was to
pinch her nose, the nostrils of which were a little
too wide; and her mother, as an habitual caress,
contented herself with pulling her eyebrows near the
temples, so as to give the almond form to her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes the husband, seized suddenly with enthusiasm
on seeing Baïla exhibit her grace when
dancing by starlight, would say in a low voice to
his wife—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Saint Demetrius, I believe the child will
some day bring us enough to furnish a cellar with
rack and tafita enough to last forever;” and a laugh
of happiness would light up his dull face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we should be so unfortunate as to lose her before
her time, it will be ten thousand good piastres
of which the Good God will rob us,” replied his
worthy companion; and she shed a tear of alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla was thirteen years old, when a <a id='bark3'></a>barque ascending
the Incour, stopped at a short distance from the
hut of the Mingrelian. A man wearing a turban
descended from it. He was a purveyor for the
harem, then on an expedition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you sell honey?” he said to the master of the
hut, whom he found at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gather white and red.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I taste it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The honest Mingrelian brought him a sample of
both kinds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would see another kind,” said the man with a
turban, with a significant glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enter then,” replied the father of Baïla, and
whilst the stranger was passing the threshold, hastening
to the room occupied by his wife, he said to
her—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be quick; the nuptials of thy daughter are preparing;
the merchant is here; he is below; arrange
her and come down with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sight of Baïla, the merchant could not restrain
an exclamation of admiration; then almost
immediately, with a commercial manœuvre he
threw up her head, preparing to examine her with
more attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this inspection the young girl blushed
deeply; the father and mother seeking to read the
secret thoughts of the merchant in his eyes and face,
kept a profound silence, beseeching lowly their
patron saint for success in the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man in the turban changing his course, and
as if he had come merely to lay in a supply of honey,
took up one of the two samples deposited on a
table, and taking up some with his finger tasted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This honey is white and handsome enough, but
it wants flavor. How much is the big measure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve thousand,” the mother hastened to reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve thousand paras?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twelve thousand piastres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merchant shrugged his shoulders—“You
will keep it for your own use then, my good woman.”
He then went toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman made a sign to her husband not to
stop him. In fact, as she had foreseen, he stopped
before reaching the door, and turning toward the
master of the house said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother in God, I have rested beneath your roof.
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
In return for your hospitality, I give you some good
advice. You have children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two daughters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, have an eye to them, for the Lesghis have
recently descended from their mountains and carried
off large numbers in Guriel and Georgia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them come,” replied the Mingrelian, “I
have three sons and four guns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merchant then made a movement of departure,
but having cast a rapid glance on Baïla, he raised
his right hand with his five fingers extended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla, red with shame, cast on him a look of contempt
and took the attitude of an insulted queen.
Thanks to that look and attitude, in which he doubtless
found some flavor, the merchant raised a finger
of his left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mingrelian showed his ten fingers, not however
without an angry glance from his wife, who
muttered, “it is too soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Honey is dear in your district,” said the man
with the turban; “I foresee I shall have to buy it
from the Lesghis against my will. Farewell, and
may Allah keep you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can we not on the one hand sell any thing, nor
on the other buy any thing without your turning
your back so quickly on us on that account?” replied
the father. “Repose still, the oar has doubtless
wearied your hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is why they are so difficult to open,”
growled the housewife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you permit it,” said the merchant, “I will
remain here until the sun has lost a little of its
power.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot offer you any thing but the shade. I
know that the children of the prophet avoid food beneath
the roof of a Christian; but instead of that you
can indulge in a permitted pleasure; as my daughter
is still here, she can sing for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla sang, accompanying herself with an instrument.
The man with the turban, seated on his
heels, his arms crossed on his knees, his head resting
on his arms, listened with a profound and immovable
attention, and when she finished, in testimony
of his satisfaction, he contented himself with
silently raising one finger more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla, to the sound of ivory castanets and small
silver bells, then performed an expressive dance,
imitating the voluptuous movements of the bayaderes
of India and the Eastern almas, but with more
reserve however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forced this time to look at her, the man with the
turban was unable to disguise the impression made
upon him by so much grace, suppleness and agility,
and, in an irrestrainable outbreak of enthusiasm, he
raised two fingers at once. They were near to a
conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this mysterious bargaining, this language of the
fingers, these mutes signs were used to enable the
parties to swear, if necessary, before the Russian
authorities, by Christ or Mahommed, that there had
been no conversation between them except about
honey, furs or beaver skins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some more bargaining on both sides, the
mother finally received the ten thousand piastres in
her apron, and disappeared immediately, to conceal
it in some hiding-place, careless whether she should
see her daughter again or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst she was gone the merchant glanced on the
elder sister of Baïla, who had assisted at the bargaining,
whilst she was kneading bread in a kneading
trough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she,” said he; “shall I not carry her off
also?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The elder sister, flattered in her vanity, made him
a reverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is lame,” said the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, oh!” said the other, “let us see—it does
not matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bargained anew, and the Mingrelian, taking
advantage of his wife’s absence, ended by selling
his oldest daughter for six English guns, a large supply
of powder and lead, some smoking materials and
two tuns of rack. Whilst he was in the humor, he
would cheerfully have sold his wife, still in fine preservation,
if custom, agreeing this time with the
new Russian code, had permitted him to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men were touching hands in conclusion
of this new bargain when the mother returned. She
uttered at first loud cries, thinking that all the household
cares were henceforth to devolve on herself
alone. The merchant was enabled to quiet her by
a present of a necklace of false stones, and some ornaments
of gilded brass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day the two Mingrelian sisters
reached a small port on the shores of the Black Sea,
whence they soon embarked for Trebizond. A
month afterward, the man with the turban being
suddenly seized with a desire to have a wife for
himself, after having furnished so many to others,
married the eldest sister, who had won his affections
by her skill in making cake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the remembrances of her family
which were awakened in the mind of the young
odalisk, when retired and alone in her apartment,
pouting and jealous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She then called up the images of that other portion
of her life, in which love was to play a part. She
returned in imagination to Trebizond, to the house
of her purchaser, become her brother-in-law. There,
like the companions of her captivity, surrounded by
attention and care, under a superintendence minute
but not severe, she passed a year, during which she
had acquired the Turkish language and skill in the
toilette, at the same time perfecting herself in singing
and dancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A year having passed, the brother-in-law of Baïla
embarked with her and several of her companions
for Constantinople. One fine morning he had dressed
his graceful cargo in white, their hair had been
anointed and perfumed, and after having passed the
walls of the old seraglio and traversed some narrow
and crooked streets, merchant and merchandise
were installed in a chamber of the slave bazaar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>European ideas concerning the sales of females in
the East are generally erroneous. Our knowledge
on this subject rests essentially on what we have
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
seen in the theatres and in pictures. But dramatic
authors and painters desirous of obtaining the picturesque
above all else, do not regard exactness very
closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter, in order not to divide their pictures
into apartments, have shown us a great common
room, in which all, males and females, all young,
all handsome and half naked, divided into groups,
pass under the inspection of the first comers. The
promenaders make the circuit of the galleries; huge
Turks, crushed beneath their turbans, and muffled
in their cashmere robes, their silk caftans and their
furs, smoke tranquilly, seated in the corner as in a
coffee-house. Sometimes, in these fantastic sketches,
a slender greyhound, with his sharp muzzle, or a
beautiful spaniel, with a flowing tail, figures as an
accessory, as in the great compositions of Reubens
or Vandyke; but in Turkey dogs are prohibited from
entering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The former, dramatic poets or authors, have boldly
established their markets on the public square, before
a crowd of chorus singers, with pasteboard
camels to add to the local coloring. It is true, that,
thanks to the convenience of the scene, the costume
of the beautiful slaves for sale has been increased.
The purchasers of women at the opera are forced to
be content with a very superficial examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bazaar of this kind is much less accessible than
these gentlemen would induce us to believe. Divided
into private chambers, the women of every
color and all ages, especially those whose youth and
beauty command a high price, are lodged almost
alone, under the custody of their sellers. In order
to penetrate the sanctuary one must be a Mussulman,
and offer guarantees, either from his position or his
fortune; for the first curious person who presents
himself is not permitted to see and buy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla and her companions entered, then, into a
saloon of the grand bazaar of Constantinople, to take
up their positions in the upper port of a chamber.
Each desirous of reigning over the heart of one of
the grand dignitaries, sought the most favorable position
to show off her attractions to the greatest advantage,
and was disposing herself so as to arm
herself with all her natural or acquired graces, when
a small old man, with a meager and mean turban, a
caftan without embroidery or furs, as old-fashioned
as its master, entered the room almost furtively. It
was an Armenian renegade, who had made his fortune
by superintending the affairs of an old vizier,
whose treasurer or <span class='it'>khashadar</span> he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst he was in the service of the latter, he had
carefully increased his wealth, and his wife, espoused
by him before his apostacy, had never permitted him
to give her a rival. By a double fate, his wife died
about the same time his vizier was sent into exile
in disgrace. Become free on both sides, the Armenian
feared no longer to exhibit his gold and his
amorous propensities, both of which he had concealed
so well for thirty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although it was a little late, he determined to recommence
his youth, to live for pleasure, and to
organize a harem. Thus, at this moment, rubbing
his hands, his figure inflamed, his small, red eyes
glistening like carbuncles, he glided round the
chamber, like a hungry fox around a poultry-yard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beautiful young girls were enraged at the
sight. In their dreams of love, each of them had
doubtless seen in her happy possessor, a handsome
young man, with a capacious brow, majestic carriage,
and black and glistening beard; and the ex-treasurer
of the vizier did not appear to have ever possessed
any of these fortunate gifts of nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not being desirous of such a customer, instead of
sweet smiles and their premeditated graceful postures,
they assumed frowning and cross looks, when the
old man stopped before Baïla, who at once trembled
and was seized with an immoderate desire to cry.
She was, however, forced to rise up, to walk about,
and notwithstanding all the want of grace she could
assume, the khashadar found her charming; he approached
her, looked at her feet and hands, and examined
her teeth, then taking the merchant aside,
said, “Thy price?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty thousand piastres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The khashadar made a bound backward; his lips
puckered up like those of a baboon who has bitten a
sharp citron; he recommenced walking around the
room, examined all those beautiful fruits of Georgia
and Circassia submitted to his inspection; he then
stopped again before Baïla. She feigning to think
that he wished to examine her mouth again, put out
her tongue and made a face at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This demonstration did not appear to cool his fire.
He reapproached the merchant, and when they had
bargained for some time, seated cross-legged, the
latter rose, saying,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the Angel Gabriel, I promised my wife,
whose own sister she is, not to part with her for
less than twenty thousand, for the honor of the
family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla, who had drawn her veil around her figure,
perceived that the bargain was concluded; and, unable
to restrain herself, burst into sobs. The door
of the room was at that moment opened roughly. A
man of lofty stature and imperious look, walked
straight up to the desolate girl; he raised her veil,
that veil which, though it concealed her tears, could
not drown her sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much for this slave?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is mine,” said the khashadar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much?” he repeats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am her purchaser, and not her seller,” said
the little old man, rising on his toes, so as to approximate
his length toward that of the interlocutor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter thrust him aside with a glance of contempt.
“I came here,” he said, “to make a purchase
to the amount of nineteen thousand piastres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty thousand is her price,” observed the
seller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I offer twenty-five thousand for her,” he replied,
throwing the veil over the figure of Baïla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merchant bent himself; the khashadar, though
pale with rage, restrained himself, for he had recognized
in his rival Ali-ben-Ali, surnamed <span class='it'>Djezzar</span>, or
the Butcher, the pacha of Shivas.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
Thus the young girl having been once sold by her
father, was again sold by her brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Djezzar Pacha, whom a slight difficulty with the
divan had called for a short time to the capital of the
empire, took his beautiful slave back with him to
his usual residence, and she at once occupied the
first place in his heart. The joy which she felt at
seeing herself elevated above all her rivals, was not
confined to a feeling of pride; she thought she loved
Djezzar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although he was no longer in his first youth, and
the severity of his glance sometimes inspired Baïla
with a feeling of terror rather than of love, yet the
first look she had cast on him in the bazaar of Constantinople,
the comparison she had then made between
him and the old khashadar, had been so much
to his advantage, that she thought him young and
handsome. He had since shown himself to be so
generous, so much in love, had complied with her
caprices and fancies with such tender indulgence,
that closing her ears to the stories in circulation about
him, she thought him good and patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, however, she is first in the love of the pacha,
she is not alone; Djezzar does not pique himself
on an unalterable fidelity. At this very time a daughter
of Amasia has entered the harem; and the women
of Amasia are regarded as the most beautiful in
Turkey. Who knows whether the scepter of beauty
is not about to change hands? May not another inspire
in Djezzar a love still stronger than that he
has shown for Baïla?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the ideas that so sadly preoccupied the
young Odalisk, when walking in the garden, she
cast by stealth those jealous looks toward the building
with gilded lattices which contained her new
rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now her courage is strengthened, her mind lit up
by sweeter lights. Did not the picture of her whole
life, which passed before her, show her that her
beauty must be incomparable, since after having
dwelt at her ease in her father’s house, she had been
an object of speculation for her brother-in-law surpassing
his extremest hopes? In the bazaar of the
women two purchasers had alone appeared, and they,
notwithstanding the choice offered them, had disputed
for her possession. But that which above
all appeared to prove her power, was the boldness
of the young Frank, who at the risk of his life had
passed the dreaded entrance of the palace of Djezzar;
who at the sight of her was so overcome as to lose
his presence of mind; who, after having seen her,
had again wished to behold her, and had anew
placed himself in her way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did he not fear death as the price of his temerity?
He did not fear because he loves—and it is thus the
Franks love. Had they not seen the most celebrated
of them, Napoleon, then Sultan, conquer Egypt with
an army, in order to seek there for a beautiful female,
whose beauty and whose country had been revealed
to him in a dream sent by God.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> Is it not also in a
dream that this young Frank has received a revelation
of the charms of Baïla? Perhaps he had seen
her during her residence at Trebizond, or on her
voyage to Constantinople? What matters it; she
owes it to him that she now feels confident and reassured.
Let Djezzar bestow his affections for one
night on the daughter of Amasia; to-morrow he will
return to the Mingrelian. And Baïla went to sleep
thinking of the young Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did she feel already for him one of those inexplicable
affections that sometimes spring up in the
hearts of recluses? By no means; his scanty costume
and beardless chin did not render him very
seductive in her eyes, and he had not been enabled
to charm her by his eloquence. But she thought she
owed him gratitude; besides, she perhaps wished to
try to avenge herself on Djezzar, even during her
sleep.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning, Baïla, followed by
Mariam, again traversed the garden, under the pretext
of erasing the tracks of the unknown, should he
have left any. The wind and the night had caused
them to disappear from the walks which were
covered with fine sand. Returning, however, from
the neighborhood of the river, she found the recent
mark of a boot impressed on a flower border. The
foot-mark was small, straight, and graceful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla hesitated to efface it. Why? Was the
stranger speaking decidedly to her heart? No; it
was a woman’s caprice, and among women the
odalisks are perhaps the most enigmatical. After
having undertaken this expedition for the very purpose
of effacing all traces of the Frank, she was now
tempted to retain the only one that remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This print, which the bostangis, with their large
sandals with wooden soles could not have left, and
which the foot of the pacha would have over-lapped
with a large margin, and which consequently might
reveal the adventure of the evening, she was desirous
of preserving. Why? Perhaps her imagination,
over-excited by her ideas of gratitude, had, at the
sight of this elegant impress, given the lie to her eyes,
by clothing the stranger with a charm, which, in his
first movement of alarm she was unable to recognize.
Perhaps, blinded by passion, Baïla was desirous that
Djezzar might see this denunciatory mark, so that
his jealousy might be alarmed, and he might suffer
in his pride and his love as she had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old negress pointed out to her, that in case
the unknown should be rash enough to return again,
the pacha, his suspicions once excited, would certainly
have him seized, and thus both might be
compromised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mingrelian then yielded; but she was unwilling,
from a new caprice, that Mariam should
remove the earth from this place. She contented
herself with placing her own delicate foot upon it
several times, and with trampling with her imprint
in that of the stranger, and this double mark remained
for a long time, protected as it was from
inspection by the superabundant foliage of a Pontic
Azalea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This shrub grew in great abundance on the slopes
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
of the Caucasus, and Baïla, when a child, had seen
them flower in her native country. She conceived
an affection for this spot, which spoke to her of her
country, and of her second and mysterious lover.
Her country she had left without regret; this young
Frank, this giaour, he had been to her at first but a surprise,
an apparition, a dream, and now, her wounded
heart demands an aliment for this double recollection.
During a whole month she took her walks in this
direction; thither she came to dream of her country
and the stranger, especially of the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did she then at length love him? Who can tell?
Who would dare to give the name of love to those
deceitful illuminations produced in the brain of a
young girl, by a fermentation of ideas, like wills-of-the-wisp
on earth; to those phantoms of a moment,
with which solitudes are peopled by those who
abandon themselves to a life of contemplation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Europe, <span class='it'>the religious</span>, though living under a
very different rule, refer all the passionate tenderness
of their soul to God; each of them finds, however,
some mode of husbanding a part of it for some
holy image of her choice, some concealed relic,
which belongs to her alone; she addresses secret
prayers to it, she perfumes it with incense which
she carries away from the high altar; it is her aside
worship. In the East, those other inhabitants of
cloisters, the odalisks, have no worship but love,
and in the endearments of that love they can prostrate
themselves but before one alone; but there, as
everywhere else, the idol is concealed in the shadow
of the temple; they have their fetishes, their dreams,
their fraudulent loves, their loves of the head, if we
may so designate them. It is perhaps necessary for
human nature thus to give the most decided counterpoise
to its thoughts, in order to preserve the equilibrium
of the soul, to protest in a low tone against
that which we loudly adore, to oppose a shadow to
a reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true that where lovers are concerned, the
shadow sometimes assumes a form and the reality
evaporates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Be this as it may, Djezzar had returned to Baïla,
and the latter, more assured than ever of her power,
made him expiate his late infidelity by her caprices
and her extravagances. They wondered in the
Harem to see the Pacha of Shivas, before whom
every thing trembled, bow before this handsome
slave, so frail, so white, so delicate, whom he might
have broken by a gesture or a word. The rumor of
it spread even to the city, where it was whispered
that Djezzar would turn Jew if Baïla wished it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Ali-ben-Ali, surnamed Djezzar, or the Butcher,
was, however, a terrible man. Originally a page
in the palace of the Sultan, and brought up by Mahmoud,
he had not participated at all in the civilizing
ameliorations the latter had endeavored to introduce
into his empire. The decree of Gulhana had found
him the opponent of all reform. Assured of a protection
in the divan, which he knew how to preserve,
he sustained himself as the type of the old
pachas, of whom his predecessors, Ali of Janina and
Djezzar of Acre, were the paragons. He especially
redoubled his barbarism when a philosophical breeze
from Europe endeavored to breathe tolerance over
his country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adjudging to himself the double part of judge and
executioner, thanks to his expeditious justice, decrees
emanating from his tribunal were executed as
soon as rendered; sometimes the punishment preceded
the judgment. A thousand examples were
cited, tending to prove clearly that in Turkey, Djezzar
was a relique of the old regime. An aga had prevaricated.
The pacha unable to inflict punishment
upon the culprit in person, as the friend of prompt
and good justice, had ordered a young effendi, his
secretary, to go at once to the residence of the prevaricator
and deprive him of an eye. The young
man hesitating and excusing himself on the plea of
his inexperience, “Come nearer,” said Djezzar to
him; and when the poor effendi approached him, the
pacha, with marvelous dexterity, plunging quickly
one of his fingers into the corner of an eye, drew out
the globe from its socket, then with a quick twist
and the assistance of his nail, the operation was performed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Slave, thou knowest now how to do it; obey at
once,” he said to him; and the poor victim, with his
wound undressed and bleeding, was constrained, on
peril of his life, to inflict on the aga the punishment
he had just undergone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one excelled as he did in cutting off a head at
a blow of the yataghan. It is true, no one else had
so much practice. There was a story told at Shivas,
of a feat of this kind which did him the highest
credit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two Arabian peasants, feulahs, were brought before
him, on a charge of murder, and each of them
accusing the other of the crime. Djezzar was perplexed
for a moment. It was possible that one of
them was innocent. Wanting proof of this, and not
being in the humor to wait for it, he thought of an
ingenious and prompt means of referring the judgment
to God. By his orders the accused were
fastened back to back by their bodies and shoulders;
he draws his sabre—the head which falls is to be that
of the guilty man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing death so near, the two wretched men
struggle to avoid falling beneath the hand of the executioner;
they turn—they shift—each endeavoring
to place his companion on the side where the blow
is to fall. Djezzar regarded this manœuvering for
some time with pleasure; at length, after having
pronounced the name of Allah three times, he made
his Damascene blade describe a large circle, and
both heads fell off at a blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding his habitual gravity, the pacha
could not avoid laughing at this unexpected result;
he laughed immoderately, which he had probably
never before done in his life, and his noisy bursts
mingled with the hoarse roars and panting of a lion,
which, confined in a neighboring apartment, inhaled
the odor of the blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This lion was his master’s favorite. Custom had
for a long time prescribed to the pachas of Shivas,
as to other pachas of the East, that they should be
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
accompanied by a lion on all solemn occasions.
Galib, the predecessor of Djezzar, and a great partisan
of reform, had a monstrous one which he fed
particularly with Janizaries; the story ran, that the
fanatical Djezzar appeased the appetite of his occasionally
with Christian flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet this ferocious man, who made a profession
of the trade of an executioner, who laughed only
when heads were cut off, who, according to public
rumor, tossed human flesh to his lion, Haïder,
felt the power of love, doubtless not gallant and perfumed
love—the love of the boudoir; but, endowed
with an energetic and voluptuous temperament, he
passed in the midst of his harem the time spared
from business; and in the East, whatever may be the
complexity of affairs, the administration, especially
under such a mastery, is reduced to such simplicity,
that leisure is never wanting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Djezzar could say with Orasmanus,</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>I will give an hour to the cares of my empire,</p>
<p class='line0'>The rest of the day shall be devoted to Zaïre.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Zaïre, that is, Baïla, awaited him on his quitting the
Council. Especially in his summer palace of Kizil-Ermak
did he spend the greater part of the day, extended
on cushions at the feet of his beautiful slave,
smoking the roses of Taif or Adrianople, mingled
with the tobacco of Malatia or Latakia, sometimes
chewing a leaf of haschich, or a grain of opium, or
even of arsenic to exalt his imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla sometimes smoked the hooka; and as they
reclined there together, plunged into a dreamy state,
full of reveries, caused by the juice of the yucca or
the poppy of Aboutig, the one opening for himself in
advance a sojourn among the celestial houris, the
other thinking, perchance, of the audacious stranger,
Haïder, the lion, drawing in his claws, would stretch,
himself familiarly beside them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla would then lean carelessly on her elbow
against this terrible creature, whilst the pacha would
listlessly permit his head to recline on the lap of the
odalisk. It was a sight to behold this beautiful
young female, robed in light draperies, reposing thus
quietly between these two ferocious beasts. She
feared neither of them; the lion was tamed as well
as the man; both obeyed her voice, her look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first, notwithstanding the violent passion of
Djezzar, Baïla had doubts as to the duration of her
power, especially when she thought of the favorite
who had preceded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This favorite, after a reign of three years, having
dared to persist in soliciting pardon for a bostangi,
who was condemned to lose his hand for having
fished fraudulently, during the night, in the fish-ponds
of the pacha, the latter, in a moment of rage, had cut
off the nose of his beautiful Aysche, and then not
desiring to keep her in that state, he had completed
the punishment of the trustless bostangi and the refractory
slave by uniting them in marriage. A piece
of ground, situated on the confines of the city, had
been given them as a dowry. Aysche now sold
vegetables in the market, where she was known by
the name of <span class='it'>Bournouses</span> (the noseless.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>This example of the instability of the power of
favorites had ceased to disturb Baïla, since the Christian
had revealed to her the secret of her power.
Besides, at the time of the events Aysche was no
longer young, which might give rise to the thought,
that her decreasing beauty, rather than any other
cause, had excited the wrath of her master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla was seventeen years old, with a Georgian
head on a Circassian body, the voice of a syren, and
the tread of a nymph—what had she to fear? Her
will had become that of the pacha. Entirely cemented
by habit to her love, he appeared never to think of
his other odalisks, except when the Mingrelian, from
caprice or petulance, revolted openly against his
desires. Then, in the presence of the rebellious
beauty, Djezzar would order a slave to carry to an
odalisk, whom he designated, a piece of goods,
which, according to the Oriental custom, announced
the approach of the master, and which in accordance
with our method of translating Turkish manners, we
have naturalized among us by the phrase of “<span class='it'>throwing
the handkerchief</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Formerly, at the idea of the infidelity which was
to be practiced toward her, Baïla fretted and pouted
in a corner with a bereaved air. Her small mouth
drawn down at the corners, muttered unintelligible
complaints and threats; her beautiful black eyes,
with their long, vibrating lashes, were half closed,
and with her head bent, and the pupils drawn back
to the angle of the eyelids, she cast upon the slave,
the master, and the brilliant piece of goods, a look
full of anger and jealousy. There her audacity
ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now, when Djezzar, to avenge himself on her,
takes a fancy to be inconstant, she falls upon the
stuff and the slave, tears the one and cuffs the other;
and if the omnipotent pacha carries out his plan of
vengeance, it frequently happens on the next day
that as the price of submission, the slave is, on some
pretext, bastinadoed, and the favorite of a day driven
away in disgrace, too happy to escape, without, like
Aysche, leaving her nose within the palace, is sent
to the bazaar to become the property of the highest
bidder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such had lately been the fate of the beautiful
daughter of Amasia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Proud in the empire she exercised over her master,
Baïla became intoxicated in the triumph of her
vanity. In the midst of its smoke, the remembrance
of the stranger, the giaour, no longer reached her
but at distant intervals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had remained shut up for a whole week without
descending into the gardens, when one day that
Djezzar had gone to raise some taxes, resuming her
old promenades, she found herself unconsciously
near the Azalea of Pontus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had become of that young Frank? Was he
still in the pachalick of Shivas? Did he still entertain
the plan of a second attempt, as Mariam had
thought he would? He had doubtless gone, returned
to his country, that singular country called France,
where they say the women rule the men; she should
see him no more. So much the better for both him
and her.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>
Whilst she was in this train of reflection a roar of
Haïder was heard without; it announced the return
of the pacha. The latter had taken him with him,
for the pleasure of letting him loose at some jackall
by the way. She was preparing to return to her
apartments to await there the arrival of Djezzar,
when a report of fire-arms, followed by a low noise,
was heard by the side of Red River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla trembled without being able to explain the
cause of her emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you been successful in hunting?” she said
to Djezzar, when they were alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, so,” he replied; “my falcon struck three
pheasants, and I killed a <span class='it'>dog</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla dared not interrogate him as to the doubtful
sense which this word might have in the mouth of
so orthodox a Mussulman as Ali-ben-Ali.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening, when Mariam came to her mistress,
after hesitating as to the information she was about
to give her, and after ten preparatory exclamations,
she informed her of the event of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the pacha was returning to his palace, and his
hunting train was straggling along by the woods of
Kizil-Ermak, near the place where they entered
the second enclosure, Haïder, whom a slave held
by a leash, stopped obstinately before a copse, growling
in low tones, which attracted the attention of
Djezzar. The copse having been beaten by the train,
a man sprung out from it, flying rapidly toward the
river, across which he endeavored to swim, but before
he could reach the opposite bank, the pacha,
snatching a gun from the hand of one of his delhis,
had drawn on the flyer with such certainty of eye
and hand, that, struck in the head, he had disappeared
immediately, carried down by the current.
This man was a Christian, but an Asiatic Christian,
as his head-dress of blue muslin proved. Besides,
the pacha said that the roar of Haïder of itself showed
what his religion was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be his country or religion what they may,” said
Mariam, finishing her story, “he is dead, dead without
any one being enabled to divine what motive
could have induced him to secrete himself on this
side of the river by the very verge of the palace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the verge of the gardens,” then interrupted
Baïla, who had listened to the recital of her old
negress without interrupting her for a moment, or
even without appearing to be greatly moved by it.
“It was into the gardens that he wished to penetrate,
as he had done before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mariam looked at her with surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” pursued the Mingrelian, “the man whom
they have killed is the young Frank, who had doubtless
changed his dress, so as not to attract too much
attention to himself by his European costume.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mariam remained silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not think so also?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some inarticulate words the negress said,
“Who can tell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thyself,” replied Baïla, “thou knowest more
than thou hast told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I avow,” added Mariam, after a little hesitation,
“that one of the delhis, who witnessed the affair,
said in my presence, that the fugitive appeared to
have a very white complexion for an Asiatic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou seest it all well, Mariam,” said Baïla,
carelessly, still playing with the fan she held in her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it is so,” replied the negress, “I am sorry for
the fate of the poor young Christian; but we at least
are out of the reach of danger in consequence of it,
and I can now sleep, for, since his double apparition
in the garden, I have but half closed my eyes. I
feared constantly some imprudence on your part
or his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faint-hearted;” and Mariam assisted Baïla in
arranging her toilet for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after daylight the Mingrelian left her solitary
couch, for Djezzar fatigued by the chase had also
slept alone, woke her old negress, and both descended
into the gardens. Baïla gave as a pretext
for her walk, her desire to breathe the fresh air of
the gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went first to the kiosk, then to the plateau,
on which she had formerly seated herself; she
cast a glance around her on the masses of flowers and
shrubs, upon the small marble basin, and fixed for
some time an attentive look upon the two palm-trees,
as if some one was about to appear between
their columns, under their green canopy. She went
then to the spot where the Azalea covered with its
shade and its flowers the last trace of the stranger;
she broke off one of the branches, stripped it of its
foliage, broke it into two, fastened together the
pieces in the form of a cross, by means of a cord
taken from a pelisse which she wore; she then set
up this cross upon the foot-print, which was almost
effaced. All this was done without any affectation
of sentiment, and with a calm and almost listless air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sight of the cross, Mariam, who was born a
Christian in Abyssinia, signed herself, after having
first cast a cautious glance around her. Baïla contented
herself with breathing a sigh, the sigh of a
child who sees a game on which it has been for some
time engaged, finished. She then returned to the
isolated pavilion, in which her suite of apartments
was situated, with her head bent down and pensive,
but thinking, perhaps, of any thing else than the
stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that moment, however, cross and fantastic
with Djezzar, she had no longer for him those soft
caresses, nor those melodious songs, nor those intoxicating
dances which accompanied the clicking
noise of her castinets, and appeared to open the gates
of the seventh heaven. She finished by irritating
him so much by her redoubled whims, caprices, and
refusals, that he left her in a fury, and remained for
three whole days without wishing to speak to her.
On the third day, the attendants came to him to inform
him that a terrible noise was heard in the
apartments of the favorite, the cries of a woman
mingled with the roarings of the lion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Djezzar sent thither, but was unwilling to go himself.
When they hastened to the assistance of the
Mingrelian, they found her shut up alone with
Haïder. The rich carpet of Khorassan, which
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
adorned the floor of her chamber, was in places rent
to pieces, and all strewed over with bits of switches
of the cherry. These shreds and fragments pointed
out the places where the strife had taken place between
the lion and the odalisk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having drawn him into her pavilion, Baïla
had shut him off from all retreat, and careless of the
result to herself, armed with a light bunch of rods,
she had struck him redoubled blows, resolutely renewing
every stick which was broken on the body
of her terrible antagonist. The latter, accustomed
to obey the voice that scolded him, and the arm that
struck him, without thinking of defending himself,
bounded from one side of the chamber to the other,
tearing up a strip of carpet with his curled talons at
each bound; but finally his patience and long endurance
exhausted, irritated by grief, groaning and
palpitating, lying half on his croupe and his back,
raising up one of his monstrous paws, he extended
his glittering talons, and became in his turn threatening,
when suddenly the bostangis and footmen of
the pacha entered, armed with boar-spears. The
door being opened, the lion fled through it in disgrace,
not before the new comers, but from the
Mingrelian, who still pursued him with her last
cherry-stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of the day in which Baïla had excited
the royal anger of the lion against herself, that
terrible animal, broken and degraded by his domestic
habits, came, like a well-trained dog, confused and
repentant, to couch at the feet of his mistress, imploring
pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day Djezzar did the same. The
favorite saw him approach her, humble, and laden
with presents. The contest of Baïla with Haïder,
of which a full account had been given to him, filled
him with a singular admiration for the former.
Baïla received the two conquered with a cold dignity,
which might pass for some remains of rigor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This double victory found her indifferent; she had
exhausted all the emotions she could experience;
she had so far distanced her rivals, that triumph over
them no longer excited her vanity; the slaves around
her were so submissive that she no longer took
pleasure in commanding them. The pacha was
tamed, tamed even to weakness, to cowardice; every
one, even the lion, submitted to the power of the
favorite, and with such unanimous accord, that in
this harem, where every thing prostrates itself before
her, and every thing is done in accordance with her
will or her caprice, she has but a single enemy whom
she cannot conquer; it is ennui. That threatened to
increase daily, and to strengthen itself by the weakness
of the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pacha went on the same day to the city;
Baïla consented to accompany him; and after having
remained a short time at Shivas, they had scarcely
returned to Kizil-Ermak, when she appeared entirely
different from what she had been at her departure.
Gayety and vivacity had returned to her; the smile
to her lips, joy to her eyes; she had refound her
sweetest songs, her most graceful dances. She was
charming in the eyes of Djezzar and even of Haïder.
It was said she had been spontaneously metamorphosed
by the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good humor of the favorite communicating
itself to the pacha, and spreading from him far and
near, all was joy in the palace that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla alone possessed the secret of this general joy.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Shut up in her palanquin, in the suite of the master,
as she was passing with the escort through one of
suburbs of Shivas, on their return to the Red River,
and was amusing herself with looking at the inhabitants,
Turks and Christians, fly, pell-mell, in disorder,
so as to hide or prostrate themselves at the
sight of the pacha, she remarked one, who, remaining
erect and motionless, did not appear to participate
in the emotions of the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla was at first astonished that the guards, the
<span class='it'>cawas</span>, did not force him to assume a more humble
posture; she examines him with more attention and
starts. He wears the dress of a Frank, and as far
as she can judge through her double veil, and the
muslin curtains of the palanquin, which were
spangled with gold, his features are those of the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By a movement quicker than thought, veil, curtains,
all are at once thrown aside. It is he—their
looks meet. The stranger is troubled. He is doubtless
again overcome by the resplendent lustre of so
much beauty; then, with an expression full of love,
he raises his eyes to heaven, and places one hand
upon his heart; he moves quickly in this hand a
small brilliant, gilded object which Baïla could not
distinguish, for the curtains had already fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This imprudent, daring scene, which occurred in
the midst of a crowd, had no witnesses, all were
flying or were prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the remainder of the route Baïla believed
she had dreamed. What, this stranger, then, was
not dead; he had not been denounced by Haïder, and
slain by Djezzar. Had she then been unjust and
cruel toward these? She owed them a reparation.
Perhaps the Frank had been only wounded. This
was very light, then, for it had not prevented him
from encountering her. Why light? Was not he
who feared not to brave every thing to reach her,
capable of enduring pain, in order to see her?
But what object had he held before her, with his hand
on his heart, and his eyes turned toward heaven?
Doubtless a present which he wished to make her,
which he desired to throw into her palanquin as a
souvenir. She had let her spangled curtains fall too
quickly. Or rather, is it not some jewel of her own,
something which had fallen from her dress, and been
found by him at the foot of the plantain, or in the
alleys of the garden? Yes, he preserves it as a precious
relic, as his guardian amulet which he wears
above his heart; for it was from thence he drew it—it
was there she saw him replace it in his transport
of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She then asked, what could this young man be
among the Franks, who had remained erect and
standing with so bold a look during the passage of the
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>
pacha, and whom the <span class='it'>cawas</span> had, notwithstanding,
appeared to respect? Yes, there were secrets connected
with him yet to be discovered. No matter!
Whatever the rank or power of this mysterious unknown
might be, she is to him an object of frenzied
love. Could she doubt it? Her vanity is gratified
by it, and in her revery, remembering Egypt and
Napoleon a second time, she came to the conclusion
that should the unknown ever command an army in
the country of the Franks, they might on some fine
day invade the pachalick of Shivas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until now, in order to rid herself of the narcotic
influence of the monotonous life of the harem, Baïla
had had recourse to fantasies of all kinds, to her
thousand and one caprices, her strifes, her poutings,
her revolts, her tyrannies over her master, his lion,
and the slaves; now, however, her character appeared
to change; she resumed the indolent and
equal humor of early days with Djezzar; she tormented
her good Mariam and her other serving women
less; her taste for dress appeared to be modified;
instead of four toilets a-day, she now only made
three; she became grave; she reflected; she thought;
she thought of the giaour; she reflected on the singular
chain of circumstance, which, in despite of
her, had mixed up this young man with all her
pre-occupations, and all the events of her recluse
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without recurring to the dangerous practice of a leaf
of haschich bruised in her hookah, or a grain of arsenic
dissolved in treacle, her imagination could now create
a new and charming world for her. She foolishly
pursued her vain reveries about the conquest <a id='off'></a>of
Shivas. She saw herself transported to another
country—to Paris—where every one could freely
admire her beauty, now the property of one only,
where she could receive the homage of all, conquering
a thousand hearts at once, whilst still reserving
her own for the beloved object. Is not that
the greatest joy and happiness known on earth to
woman?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But could not this revery be realized without the
intervention of any army? Baïla waited for some
time for some realization of her chimera; then,
when she had ceased to think of it, ennui, terrible
ennui again took possession of her. Sickly languor
succeeded. She sought a cause for her suffering,
and that cause she found in the walls of the harem,
which oppressed and stifled her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sultan Mahmoud, during the latter part of his
life, had permitted his women to leave the seraglio,
well escorted and supervised. The younger dignitaries
of the Sublime Porte, the avowed partisans of
the new order of things, following his example, had
in their turn essayed this usage. Baïla knew it, and
she determined to conquer this pleasant liberty for
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the very mention of it to the pacha, he regarded
her with fierce and flashing eyes, and swore by Mahomet
and the four caliphs, it was his dreaded oath,
that if any other of his women had made such a
proposal to him, her head would have already leaped
off at a blow from his yatagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla desisted, but the refusal increased the intensity
of the desire which she felt. She also swore,
not by the four caliphs, but by her woman’s will, to
attain her end, whatever road she must travel, or
whatever peril she must brave. The mere idea of
this new struggle in which she was engaged, cured
her of half her languor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was this end? She must first examine herself
in order to define it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the summit of the terraces of the winter
palace she had already seen a part of the monuments
of the city; she had visited the citadel, the caravansery,
the mosque in the train of the pacha. It
was not, therefore, for this that she aspired to this
phantom of freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bazaars remained; but had not the pacha
caused to be conveyed to the harem whatever they
contained precious and rare in brocades, velvets,
precious stones, and sculptured gold, that she might
see and choose from them? The privation could
not then be felt on this account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Magicians, jugglers, the musicians of Persia and
Kurdistan, every pigmy deformity, every curious
object which traversed the pachalick, was, at a word
from her, admitted into the palace. She arrived at
this logical conclusion, that if she desired to visit
and traverse Shivas, it was in the hope of finding there
again the unknown, of finding the key of the mysteries
which surrounded her; and this unknown was certainly
the only one of the curiosities of the city, to
which Djezzar would refuse permission to enter his
harem for the diversion of the favorite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But could not another make the discovery for
Baïla? She thought at once of Mariam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter, who was a partial purchaser of provisions
for the harem; freed by her employment, her
age, and her color, from the ordinary ceremonial,
she traversed the streets and market-places at pleasure.
Baïla knew her devotion to her person, and
should she refuse to serve her in her researches, she
knew that the old negress would not betray her.
She spoke to her then about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abyssinian seized with a sudden trembling,
exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the Holy Christ! do not repeat those words,
my dear mistress; resist the temptation, stifle it in
your heart; it is an inspiration of the Evil Spirit, or,
perhaps, a purpose of Providence, perhaps an inspiration
from on high,” she murmured in a low
voice, as if apostrophizing herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have nothing to fear, Mariam; of what
crime will you be guilty, for endeavoring to make
some inquiries about this stranger? It is well known
that old women are curious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young ones are no less so,” she replied, casting
a reproachful glance at her, “and their curiosity
draws more perils after it. Our holy mother, Eve,
was young when—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you refuse to serve me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This time I do; do not exact it, do not insist
upon it. I have already had so much to struggle
against on the other side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>
“This young Frank. He is born to be your destruction
and mine. But no; if you knew—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know him then? Are you dreaming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I spoken of that? By the black angel I
hope it is nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou wert about to betray thyself; hast thou
seen him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! my dear mistress do not destroy me,” exclaimed
the old slave, trembling with fright. “Yes,
I have seen him to my misfortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, who is he? What keeps him at Shivas?
What does he want? What does he hope for?
What are his plans?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it for me to inform you? In the name of the
God of the Christians, who has been yours and is
still mine, cease to question me. If our master
should only discover that this young man has penetrated
here into the gardens, I know that I should
be put to death. I should be cut to pieces and
thrown to feed the fish in the ponds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he shall not know it. Thou hast nothing to
fear, I tell thee; am not I here to protect thee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But thee? Who will protect thee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What matters it? Then you know this stranger?
Thou hast met him, and hast told me nothing of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless it has so happened, though he would
have preferred meeting another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who is that other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thyself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me!” exclaimed Baïla, with her face suffused
with blushes, as if she did not expect this reply,
which she had skillfully extracted in order to force
Mariam into her confidence. “And what does he
want with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he want?” replied the old negress,
again a prey to her first emotion. “What does he
want? God keep me from saying?! He alone can
tell you. But it will be death perhaps for us three.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla was silent for a moment. “He has hoped
to see me again?” she then asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If one may believe him, he would give his life a
thousand times to realize this hope; and moreover—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else does he wish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is his secret, not mine, I have already said
too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were interrupted; Mariam retired abruptly
and Baïla remained alone with the serpent of curiosity
which was gnawing into her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly afterward, during the night, whilst the
pacha was at the city of Tocata, where the cares of
government detained him, a man was brought furtively
into the gardens of the Red River. A bostangi
had found means to introduce him in a flower vase.
This bostangi, gained by rich presents, conducted
him by then deserted paths to the pavilion of the
favorite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla was in the bath, when the Abyssinian negress
appeared and made her a signal. The beautiful
odalisk, under a pretext of a desire to repose,
then dismissed her serving-women, after they had
bound up her hair and carefully perfumed her person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her slaves dismissed, she dressed herself with the
assistance of Mariam, but in such haste that her
cashmere girdle, tied negligently, kept her robe
scarcely half closed, and her long veil thrown around
her, alone concealed the richness of her shoulders
and bust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped on her way to the saloon in which
the mysterious visiter awaited her. Her respiration
failed, a nervous tremor agitated her beautiful limbs,
and made her skin, still moist with rose-water and
the essence of sandal-wood, to shiver—placing her
hand on her heart to restrain, as it were, its tumultuous
beatings, she murmured, “I am afraid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you fear now?” said Mariam, sustaining
her by her arms, and whose courage, like a
game of see-saw, appeared to be exalted and strengthened
in proportion as that of her mistress failed.
“The pacha is far off—every thing around us sleeps;
this Frank, whom you desired to see and whom you
are about to see, has crossed the portals of the palace
without awakening suspicion. He awaits you; he
has not trembled in coming to you; time is precious,
he counts it impatiently, let us join him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid,” said Baïla, resisting the impulse
which the old slave wished to give her, and trembling
all over, with her body bent, her eyes half
closed, she appeared to drink in with delight the
alarm she experienced; as the sick, saturated with
tasteless and sugared beverages, rejoice in the bitter
draughts of abscynthe. It was an emotion, and
every emotion is precious to a recluse of the harem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She entered finally the saloon in which the unknown
awaited her, but not without casting another
glance on the <span class='it'>abandon</span> of her toilet. By the feeble
light of two candles placed in a bracket, she saw the
stranger standing in a meditative posture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the rustling of her robe, at the light sound of
her step, he raised his head, crossed his hands with
a kind of ecstatic transport, and his eyes, raised to
the gilded ceiling, sparkled so brightly, that it appeared
to the Mingrelian as if the light about her
was doubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mariam had disappeared, the better to
watch over them, when Baïla found herself alone
with her unknown, with the lover of her day dreams,
casting her veil suddenly aside, she revealed herself
to him in all the glory of her Georgian beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She enjoyed his pleasure, his surprise, for a moment,
then seating herself on a corner of the sofa,
motioned him to a seat by her side. But the stranger
remained immovable; his only motion was to cover
his eyes as if the light had suddenly blinded him.
After having sweetly gratified her pride by the stupefying
effect produced by her resplendent beauty,
she repeated her gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frank, still embarrassed and hesitating, went
now toward the sofa, and bending with downcast
eyes almost to the earth before her, took hold of the
end of her long veil and re-covered her entirely,
turning away his head. This movement surprised
Baïla strangely; but she said to herself, “perhaps
it is one of the preliminaries of love among the
Franks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to me,” said the young man, then, with a
voice full of emotion, and seating himself beside
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
her; “listen to me with attention; the present moment
may become for you as well as for myself the
commencement of a new era of glory and safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not understand him, she drew nearer to
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are born a Christian,” he continued, “Mingrelia
is your country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla thought for an instant that he had himself
come from the ancient Colchis; that he had seen
her family; and in the rapid flight of her fancy she
saw the love of this young man remount not only to
a recent period, but also to that time in which she
was still the property of her father. The recollections
of her natal country beaming pleasanter to her
by uniting themselves with the idea of a love from
childhood, she came yet nearer to him and looked
at him carefully, hoping to find in his face features
impressed of old upon her memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are then a friend of my brothers?” she said
to him. At this moment of expansion the Mingrelian
placed her hand on that of the stranger. The
latter trembled, rose at once and making the sign of
the cross, said with a voice full of unction and
solemnity—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am the friend of your brothers, your brothers
the Christians, now trampled under foot by a
cruel despot, but one whom you can soften. The
terrible Daker, the master of a part of Syria and
Palestine, after he took for his minister a Christian,
Ibrahim Sabbar, became the protector of the disciples
of Jesus Christ. Do you not exercise over your
master a power greater than Ibrahim did over his?
A power that they say the very lions do not resist.
God made use of Esther to touch the heart of Ahasuerus;
he has marked you like her with his seal,
to concur in the deliverance of his people. Faith has
revealed it to me. Thanks to you, Ali-ben-Ali, the
Pacha of Shivas, the butcher, the executioner, shall
no longer turn his rage but against the enemies of
the church. The divine light descending from the
cross of Calvary shall penetrate the most hardened
hearts—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wretch!” exclaimed Baïla, awakening at last
from the stupor into which this unexpected discourse
had thrown her, “what has brought you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To teach you to mourn over your past life, to
assist you in washing yourself from your sins, to
save you, and with you, and by you, our brethren
the Christians of Shivas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go then, apostle of the demon—retire, insolent,”
repeats the beautiful odalisk, enveloping herself in
her veil, the better to conceal herself from the looks
of the profane; “go then, and be accursed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you shall not drive me away thus,” replied
the young enthusiast; “you shall hear me. God,
who inspired me with the idea of this holy mission
which I am now discharging, is about to change
your heart; he can, he will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thy God is not mine, impious; depart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! do not blaspheme the God of your fathers;
do not deny the holy belief which even without your
knowledge has perhaps remained in your heart.
Was it not you who, in a retired part of your garden,
reared the humblest of crosses, doubtless to go
thither to pray in private?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This word, this remembrance of the branch of the
azalea, brought suddenly to the memory of the young
odalisk all the chimeras of her fantastic loves, all
the hopes, all the illusions which were grouped by
her around a single idea; the disgust at finding all
her reveries effaced; the frightful thought of the
peril she had sought, had braved, and which still
threatens her at that very moment, and all to arrive
at such a deception—to find an apostle when she expected
a lover—so troubled her mind, that her voice,
gradually rising, appeared to reach beyond the pavilion,
and reach the sleeping slaves. To endeavor
to calm her, the stranger, with a suppliant gesture,
advanced a step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not approach me,” she exclaimed, and rising
with a groan, she called Mariam. She was about
to leave the room, still uttering imprecations, when
the door was thrown quickly open and the pacha
appeared suddenly, surrounded by soldiers, and carrying
a complete arsenal of arms of all kinds at his
girdle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether the wrath of the Mingrelian had reached
its height, or whether the sentiment of self preservation
awakened imperiously in her, rendered
her pitiless, she exclaimed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kill him—kill him!” and with her finger designated
the unfortunate Frank to the vengeance of the
pacha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man cast a momentary sad and pitying
look upon her, which made her start; he then held
out his head, a soldier raised his sabre, but Djezzar
turned the blow aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said he, “he must not die so quickly;”
and casting a suspicious glance by turns upon the
two, he murmured in a low voice this frightfully
poetic phrase, “his blood should not leap suddenly
like water from the fountain, but flow gently like
that of the spring which falls drop by drop from the
rock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the East, poetry is found every where.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then said something in the ear of a Mangrebian
slave near him, and the Christian was led away.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Djezzar, left alone with Baïla, gave vent at first to
all his jealous passions; but with him the favorite
had nothing to dread but an explanation, commencing
with a blow from his dagger. As soon as she found
him confine himself simply to threats and reproaches,
she ceased to fear for her life. Assuming an attitude
of surprise, a look of disgust, whilst still endeavoring
to appear as handsome as possible, she sought to
make use of all her advantages and to employ in her
favor with the Turk that toilette of carelessness prepared
coquettishly for the Christian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Djezzar, who had on that day returned from Tocata
to Shivas, had been informed in the latter city
of the intention of the Frank to penetrate into the interior
of his harem; but he had no proof of the complicity
of his beautiful slave. Baïla perceived it.
He who could have given those proofs was, doubtless,
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
expiring at that very moment. Were there not
also to assist her, her imprecations against the giaour
and her movement of terror and flight, of which the
pacha himself was a witness. Thus, the latter was
soon convinced and the tables turned; it was now
the master who, humble and suppliant, lowly implored
her pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was, however, preparing a terrible proof for
the influence of the Mingrelian. Baïla, irritated at
having been suspected, was already raising her voice
higher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” said the pacha, imposing silence by a
gesture, and appearing himself to hearken to a certain
movement which was manifested without. She
listened, but heard nothing but a low, confused, monotonous
and regular sound, like that of threshing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing—nothing at all,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both remained thus, for a time, attentive; the
noise was repeated, but did not increase. Djezzar
became impatient, and, yielding to the feeling, struck
his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have not my orders been executed?” he demanded
of the Mangrebian slave who appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have, son of Ali; but in vain have we used
on this Christian cords armed with lead and thongs
of the skin of the hippopotamus; in vain have we
moistened and sprinkled his gaping wounds with pimento
and lemon juice; he has not uttered a cry or
a groan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he, then?” asked the Pasha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He prays,” replied the slave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he revealed nothing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, son of Ali.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If my chastisements cannot loose his tongue, my
clemency may,” said Djezzar, with a sinister smile.
“Let him be brought before me, and let Haïder
come also. By Allah, I will myself teach him to
speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Mangrebian had departed, Djezzar, alone
with Baïla, became at once the man of the harem—the
effeminate, the voluptuous pacha; he caused her
to resume her seat on the divan, and he himself
stretched at her feet, smoking his hooka, engaged, apparently
alone, in watching the smoke from his Persian
pipe escape on one side in massive clouds to remount
from the other, purifying itself in a crystal
flask full of perfumed water. He awaited, in this
indolent posture, the arrival of his captive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This captive was named Ferdinand Laperre.
Born at Paris, of a good family of the middle classes,
of a character addicted to exaltation and revery, an
orphan from his cradle, he had been unable to give a
natural course to his sensibilities. Notwithstanding
his university education, the religious sentiment had
germinated and developed itself in him. In the
want of those tender affections of which he was
ignorant, holy and ardent belief had filled the void in
his soul. He held a small employment in the office
of the minister of foreign affairs, when one day at
the close of a sermon, by the Abbé La Ardaire, he
determined to become a priest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His only remaining relative, an uncle, recently
appointed to a consulate in one of the important
cities of Asia Minor, thought it best to take him with
him in the capacity of a cadet. He hoped to divert
him from his pious abstractions, to induce him to renounce
his plans, and to lead him even to doubting,
by the sight of those numerous sects of schismatic
Christians who inhabit the east. The uncle was a
philosopher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But faith was more brightly kindled in the heart
of the neophyte as he approached those holy places
in which evangelical truths had borne their first
branches and produced their most savory fruits.
The summits of Taurus were for him illuminated by
the lightnings of Tabor and Sinai. More than ever
strengthened in his first calling, he wore hair-cloth
beneath his diplomatic dress, and promised himself,
should the occasion offer, to accomplish, in despite
of his relative, a novitiate signalized by apostolic
labors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having perfected himself in the Turkish and
common Arabian languages, he went to Shivas and
its environs, on a visit to the followers of the different
dissenting churches—Armenians, Greeks, Maronites,
Nestorians, Eutycheans and even Latin
Catholics, separated from Rome only by the marriage
of their priests. He went among them to effect
conversions; he was more alarmed at their misery
than their ignorance, and, like a true apostle, he returned
among them less to preach to them than to
succor them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was passing down the Red River one day, on
a small skiff, which he had learned to manage in the
eastern style, dreaming of the desert and of an hermitage
in some Thebais, and was creating in the
future an ascetic happiness, tempered with clear
water, when the oar broke. His <a id='bark1'></a>barque stranding,
cast him upon a small spot, a delta, located as an
island, between Kizil-Ermak and a regular ditch.
Ferdinand was not a skillful swimmer, but, notwithstanding
the usual sedateness of his thoughts, he
was a good jumper. He measured with his eye the
river and the ditch by turns, and the question being
decided in favor of the latter, he crossed it at a bound.
The ditch passed, he perceived a low wall, which
had been hidden from his view by a thick copse of
nopals and wild apricot trees. Had he jumped back,
to regain his delta, it would have been at the risk of
his neck, for he had now no room to take a start; and
should he succeed, he would still have an impassable
river before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst in this position, very much embarrassed
what to do, and not doubting that he was in the
neighborhood of the summer gardens of the pacha,
he perceived a low door in the wall; he tried it, and
to his great joy it opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are about Shivas, and especially on the
banks of the river, enclosures in which the cultivators,
chiefly Christians, from the great abundance of
water, raise vegetables for the market, and enormous
citrons, savory water-melons, dates, and pistachios
which rival those of Aleppo and Damascus.
Ferdinand thought he had reached one of those
Christian enclosures; the carelessness evinced in
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
closing the gate strengthened the idea. He entered.
Then, for the first time, he found himself face to
face with Baïla, who was seated carelessly beneath
the plantain tree. More surprised than charmed at
the sight of the graceful odalisk, bedaubed with red
and black, he could only stammer forth a few words,
expressive of his eager desire to escape, safe <a id='and'></a>and
sound, from this perilous adventure, which he
had not sought. Entrapped in the windings of the
garden, he had again found himself in the presence
of Baïla and the negress. Regaining at last, with
difficulty, the little gate, which was still open, he
was again alarmed at the double obstacle of the
ditch and the river, when, in the midst of the shades
of the evening, he saw a man advance, mysteriously,
toward the delta, traversing the Kizil-Ermak by a
ford, of which Ferdinand was quite ignorant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This man, one of the bostangis of the pacha, stole
his master’s fruit to sell in the city. It was he who
had left open the little gate, which was only used
when the ditch was repairing. After having, on that
day, pointed out to Ferdinand a mode of escaping
from his embarrassment, it was he afterward, who,
held by Baïla between the fear of denunciation and
the hopes of reward, had introduced the Frank into
the gardens, and even into the pavilion of the
favorite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having reached the delta, the bostangi drew from
beneath a mass of overhanging rock, a long plank,
which he used to cross the ditch; he then deposited
it beneath the mass of nopals and wild apricots, in
which Ferdinand was concealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw a miracle from heaven in this concourse
of unhoped for circumstances, co-operating in his
deliverance. This plank became an ark of safety
for him; he used it in his turn, and, thanks to the
ford which the bostangi had revealed to him, after
having wandered for some time in its unknown
paths, after having struggled anew with the Kizil-Ermak,
which, like a serpent in pursuit of its prey,
he found everywhere on his path, and which appeared
to wish to envelop him in its twistings and windings,
he escaped finally all the dangers of his eventful
walk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having returned to the consulate in Shivas he had
double cause to congratulate himself on having arrived
there safe and sound, when he learned that the
gardens into which he had so foolishly adventured
were none other than those of Djezzar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But this woman whom he had seen—who could
she be? When he thought of his meeting with her,
he thought he had dreamed or had seen a vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She reappeared before him in a multitude of forms;
he saw her resembling a Bacchante, her cup in her
hand, reclining indolently on a tiger’s skin; then,
like a Peri or an Undine, when appearing to him
through the gilded reflection of the sun and the
rainbows of the small marble basin; and, finally, in
her third transformation, erect, severe, irritated, ordering
him to fly and threatening him with a dagger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His calm and chaste imagination lent, however,
no charm to this triplicity of forms. He asked himself,
on the contrary, if this vision did not present to
him an emblem of all the vices united—intoxication,
licentiousness, idleness, anger? He found means to
complete the seven cardinal sins. In those accursed
gardens, which were inhabited by the persecutor of
the Christians, was it not the demon himself that
had appeared to him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, whilst Baïla was making of him a being
apart—a marvelous being—whose traces she was
honoring, an idol to which she was rendering the
homage of love, he was piously entertaining a holy
horror of her remembrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This demon, however—this frightful assemblage
of the seven cardinal sins, was essaying every means
to approach him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ferdinand, whilst sojourning with his uncle in this
province of Anti-Taurus, was but little concerned
about what was taking place in the harem of Djezzar.
His thoughts were elsewhere. But after his
involuntary visit to the gardens, he lent a more attentive
ear to what was said about the pacha. He
learned that the latter, abandoned entirely to voluptuousness,
submitted to the control of a favorite Mingrelian.
Soon, without knowing his own share in
increasing the sway of the beautiful slave, he heard
it repeated every where around him that, did she
will it firmly, Baïla could make a Jew of her master,
Ali-ben-Ali.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not a Christian?” he said to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All his thoughts were, from that day, concentrated
on this single one—“She is a Christian, and can do
any thing with Djezzar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oh, how did his divine mission aggrandize in his
eyes that toy, which was a small golden cross,
which his mother had worn and which never left
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We know the result of the execution of this holy
and bold enterprise, the first terrible consequences
of which Ferdinand was now undergoing, and the
conclusion of which he foresaw, when, after his preparatory
punishment, he was led before the pacha,
with his hands bound tightly behind his back. The
latter was still extended upon his cushion; his head
and the arm which held his pipe reposed on the
knees of the Mingrelian and his lion Haïder, crouched
upon his paws, with his muzzle to the floor and his
eyes half closed, was by his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slaves retired at a gesture from their master;
the scene which was to follow needed no witnesses.
The pacha, the Mingrelian, the Christian and the
lion alone remained.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla felt her confidence vanish; a single revelation
from the prisoner would be a decree of death to
her, and concealing her paleness beneath the redoubled
folds of her veil, she awaited the examination
with a palpitating heart, fixing her curious gaze
upon the prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did I risk my life to listen to a sermon
from this mournful preacher?” she said to herself.
“Why did they not kill him when I commanded?
Why did he not fall beneath the blow of the guard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seeing him, however, with his body furrowed by
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
bluish stripes, his flesh swollen and bloody, standing
in that saloon as if he had never left it to be handed
over to executioners, as he did before the arrival of
the pacha, with the same air, the same timid look,
which he dared not raise toward her, she felt an
emotion of pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christian,” said the pacha, “what motive
brought thee hither?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her salvation,” replied the captive, turning his
eyes for a moment to the sofa on which the odalisk
was seated, and then letting them fall on Djezzar, he
added, “and thine, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, dog, and son of a dog, as thou art, didst
thou think to make a vile Nazarene of me, and to
convert me to the sect of the accursed, by taking advantage
of my absence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have said the truth,” replied the young man,
“as true as that Jesus Christ is the redeemer of the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou liest,” replied the pacha, “as true that
there is no God but God, and that Mahomet is his
prophet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this outbreak he appeared to endeavor to restrain
his anger. He replaced himself more at his
ease upon the knees of his favorite, passed his hand,
as a motion of caress, through the mane of his lion,
and when he had taken two or three whiffs of his
batakie, resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See that thou art sincere, and do not aggravate
thy crime. Thou knowest well that a Mussulman
cannot become a Christian, as a Christian cannot become
a Jew. The law of Moses paved the way for
that of Jesus; that of Jesus was but the precursor to
that of Mahomet. On this ladder men never descend—they
mount upward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had hoped, at least,” said the captive, “to render
thee more favorable to my brethren.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are, then, all those bands of rascals who gnaw
each other—all those races of infidels, who are forgetful
of their own law, thy brethren? Of what do
they complain? Of some I have made good Christians
by martyrdom; of others, good Musselmen by
persuasion. Besides, art thou one of their priests?
No, far from that. Thou art but one of those frivolous
Europeans, who seek to propagate their impious
usages among us. Lay aside trick and falsehood.
Thou hast heard of the beauty of this slave, (turning
his head toward Baïla,) and thou hast desired to satiate
thy eyes at the price of thy life. Is it not
so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man made a sign of negation; the pacha
heeded it not, and proceeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, art thou satisfied? Thou shouldst be, for
thou hast seen her. Are your women of Europe so to
be disdained, that you must come among us to carry
off ours? Until now you have coveted our horses
only. How didst thou find means to correspond with
her? Who was thy guide? How did she first see
thee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a tiger, which with eye and ear watches for
the least cry, the least motion of the prey it is about
to seize, Djezzar watched for a word of avowal—a
denunciatory sign on the part of him whom he interrogated.
He obtained none from him, but he felt the
knees of Baïla tremble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Christian,” he resumed, “I repeat to thee, be
sincere. Tell me what hope thou hast conceived;
tell me who introduced thee into this place; name
thy accomplice, and whatever may be thy fault I
will place in the other scale thy youth and thy consular
title, although thy presence in the midst of my
harem at night gives me a right to forget it. But I
will consider what thou hast already endured, and,
like Allah, I will be merciful. Speak; I listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He inhaled again the odorous smoke of his pipe,
and appeared to await a reply; but the captive remained
silent and motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak, Christian, speak! There is yet time. At
this price alone canst thou purchase thy life—by abjuring
thy idolatry, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this last sentence the young man raised his
head—a noble blush mounted to his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To denounce and apostatize,” said he; “is such
thy clemency, pacha? Have thy executioners forgotten
to tell thee who I am? Art thou, who hast
thyself honored me with the title of Christian, ignorant
of the duties which this title enjoins? Dost
thou think that the disciples of Christ care so much
for this mortal life, as to plunge their souls twice
into ineffaceable pollution?” and his eye sparkled,
and his whole countenance assumed an expression of
sublime beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is said,” said Djezzar, forming, from his apparent
imperturbability, a fine contrast with the exaltation
of the young Frank. “Thou wishest to die, and
thou shalt die. But dost thou know for what an end
I reserve thee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it what it may, I am ready,” replied the captive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then thou regrettest nothing of this mortal life?”
and the pacha followed his look attentively, which
he thought he would fix on Baïla.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” said the young man, with his eyes
cast down, “but the not being assisted at my last
moments by a priest of my religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Djezzar appeared to reflect; a slight smile then
contracted his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If thy wishes go no farther,” he said, “they
shall be gratified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mangrebian reappeared at his call. A few
moments afterward an old man, with a bald head, a
long white beard, and a severe countenance, entered.
He trembled violently at the sight of the pacha, as if
he thought his last hour was come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a poor Maronite monk, sent recently by
the patriarch of Mount Libanus to replace the superior
of the convent of Perkinik, who was dead.
The pacha had, whilst passing on that day through
this Catholic village, in the environs of Shivas,
wished to make an exaction on this miserable convent,
in which a few monks, covered with rags,
lived by the labor of their hands, in the midst of a
population as miserable as themselves. Djezzar, unable
to extort the money which they had not, had
carried off their superior with him, to detain him as
a hostage until the sum demanded was paid.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
“<span class='it'>Kaffer</span>,” he said to him, “thou hast refused to
pay the taxes of <span class='it'>Miri</span> and <span class='it'>Karadj</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Christians of Libanus are exempt from them
since the capitulation of the holy King Louis,” replied
the unfortunate man, whose voice betrayed a
violent emotion. “The Vice Roy Mehemet Ali regarded
us as exempt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To hell with the old rascal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the sultans themselves have recognized this
law, your highness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no law here but my will,” replied the
pacha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I do to disarm thy severity,” blubbered
out the old man, fixing his terrified look upon
the lion crouched beside Djezzar, and of which he
already considered himself the prey. “I have nothing
in the world which thou canst take from me,
but my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which I will do if thou dost not obey me at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, to acquit this impost—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the koran, who is now speaking to thee of
imposts? Of <span class='it'>Karadj</span> and <span class='it'>Miri</span> I hold thee acquitted,
thou and thine, forever, and thou art free, and shalt
leave here carrying with thee more piastres than I
demanded of thee; but before we separate thou must
call down the curses of thy God on that dog there.”
Then, turning to his other captive, he continued:
“Yes, thou art about to die, and die accursed by a
priest of thy religion. Inch Allah, wilt thou speak
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an heroic resignation Ferdinand, as his only
reply, kneels and bows his head, devoted at once
to the sabre and anathema, when he hears the old
Cenobite of Libanus, raising his trembling hands
above his head, say to him, in a soft voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If thou art a Christian, I bless thee, my son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These holy words were scarcely pronounced when
the old man fell, shot dead. Baïla fell backward
with a movement of horror, and the pacha, with unbounded
impassibility, replaced his pistol in his belt.
He interrupted this movement suddenly to restrain
his lion by the mane, which, animated by the sight
of blood, was about to spring with a roar on the
body of the Maronite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carry off that corpse,” said Djezzar to the Mangrebian,
“and leave us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dead body carried off, the Mangrebian gone,
turning to the lion, which, with open mouth and
thirsty and trembling lips, was uttering low growls
and darting his brilliant glance toward the prey
which was carried from him, Djezzar, restraining
him by voice and gesture, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be patient, Haïder; thy part shalt soon come—thou
shalt not lose by the exchange.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He then resumed his first position, and whilst the
lion, restrained by him, continued its low roaring,
with its eyes fixed on a large spot of blood on the
carpet, and addressing Baïla, without appearing to
notice the emotions of terror by which she was agitated,
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the giaour is for us three—for each a part.
For me, his head; for the lion, his body; and for
thee, my beautiful rose of Incour—my faithful, for
thee, his heart. Has he not given thee that heart?
Well, go take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla, undecided, troubled with horror, knew not
what meaning to attach to his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, take it,” repeated Djezzar. “look, behold!
powerless to defend himself, does he not appear himself
to offer it to thee? Go, my soul, and if thy
dagger is not enough for the work, use mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The odalisk bent toward him—“Thou art sporting
with me, Ali—is it not so?” she murmured in his
ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dost thou not hear me, or art thou unwilling to
understand me?” he replied, in a formidable tone.
“This man dies—dies at once, by thy hand, or I
shall believe thee to be his accomplice, and thy head
shall fall before his. I swear it, by Mahomet and
the four caliphs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baïla, having to choose between inflicting or receiving
death, felt an icy coldness in her veins; her
forehead became lividly pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou hesitatest!” said the pacha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She carried a trembling hand to her dagger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take mine,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hand of Baïla fell on the shoulder of Djezzar,
and remained there as if paralyzed; her troubled
eyes were raised furtively toward the young Frank,
even on that very evening the object of her reveries of
love; toward that young martyr, who by a word
could destroy her, and who was about to die—to die
for her, for being unwilling to pronounce that word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wilt thou obey?” said the executioner, with a
gesture of impatient rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hand of Baïla descended from the shoulder of
Djezzar and played inquisitively among the arms
which formed an arsenal at his belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thou tremblest—thou art unwilling to do it?
Thou lovest him then!” he exclaimed at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I love him,” replied the Mingrelian, and
bounding suddenly forward she sheathed the blade of
the yataghan full in the breast of the pacha. Though
mortally wounded he still made an effort to seize his
other pistol, but, at a gesture from Baïla, the lion
Haïder, excited anew by the sight of the flowing
blood, springing on his master did his part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst Ferdinand, alarmed at what was passing,
was closing his eyes, stretching out in terror his
bound arms, the Mingrelian, endowed with wonderful
presence of mind, gathered quickly into one corner
of the saloon the light furniture and stuffs which
were in it; she set them on fire, and seizing the
young Frank, who was more dead than alive, by his
bonds, led him toward a secret outlet, which conducted
them to the sleeping chamber of the Abyssinian
negress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The palace of Kizil-Ermak, which was of Turkish
construction—that is, built of wood—was almost entirely
consumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the next day the news mongers of Shivas endeavored
to define the causes of this great event.
Some said that the pacha had been strangled by his
lion, and that, in the struggle between these two
fierce beasts a torch was upset, which was the cause
of the fire. Others, reasoning from the usage of the
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>
ancient Ottoman regime, and claiming to be better
informed, said that a man, wearing the dress of a
Frank, after having sojourned in the city long
enough to avert suspicion as to the object of his
secret mission, had introduced himself into the presence
of the pacha in the very interior of his harem;
when the latter had ordered his slaves to behead him,
the pretended Frank, who was no other than the
<span class='it'>capidgé-bechi</span> of the sultan, had shown his <span class='it'>katcherif</span>,
and that the head of Djezzar had alone fallen. The
fire had broken out in the midst of the disorder, and
the <span class='it'>capidgé-bechi</span>, taking advantage of the great
crowd attracted thereby, had escaped, in a new disguise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty other versions were in circulation, almost
all of which were repeated by the journals of
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst in Shivas, Rocata, and other cities of the
pachalick, they were thus indulging in explanations
more or less truthful, Baïla and Ferdinand, who
had been enabled to escape in disguise from the
palace, thanks to the confusion and the crowd, concealed
themselves at first in the mountains to the
south of Shivas, where some Kurdish brigands took
them under their protection, exacting a very moderate
ransom; they then found an asylum in a convent,
then twenty others in the caverns or depths of
the woods of Avanes, always, however, continuing
their path steadily up the Red River. Having finally
entered the dominions of the Shah of Persia, they
returned to France in the train of the last embassy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these wanderings Ferdinand lost some of his
ardor for proselytising. He had traveled across
mountains and valleys by day and by night, carrying
temptation with him; Baïla had really become to
him the demon which he had fancied her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the beautiful Mingrelian, his liberator, and
the companion of his flight, walking at the same pace,
in the same pathway, sleeping under the same
shelter, cared for and watched over by her, it had
been difficult for him to prevent his heart from beating
under other inspirations than those of divine
love. Ferdinand was twenty-five years old, and
gratitude has great sway over a generous soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still in the first days of their common flight he
had converted his schismatic companion, who, from
her indifference to matters of religion, was easy to
persuade; but it was said that in her turn she had
soon converted him. What is positively known
about it is, that the young man did not return to
France alone, but that when his passport was exhibited
at Marseilles, it provided for M. Ferdinand
Laperre, consular cadet, traveling <span class='it'>with his sister</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend, the illustrious traveler, had already
furnished me with all the details of the history I have
recounted; but my curiosity was not yet fully satisfied.
I wished to know the fate of the lovers after
their arrival in France. I pressed him with questions
on this point, and at first uselessly. We were
breakfasting in the open air, on the lawn at the
Butard, and my botanist, in an exultation difficult to
describe, was fully occupied with a godsend he had
found beneath the table we had used. It was a
small plant with shaggy and lanceolate leaves, with
flowers of pale yellow, marked with a violet spot at
the base of their five petals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Cistus guttatus! Helianthemum guttatum!</span>”
he exclaimed, with cries and gestures impossible to
describe to any one who has not the heart of a botanist.
“I thought it only existed in the mountains
of Anti-Taurus, from whence I brought away so
carefully an unique specimen. It was my finest
vegetable conquest, and lo I find it here at the Butard
at Luciennes, a suburb of Paris, beneath the table of
a tavern. How can this be? Taurus and the Butard
rivals in their productions? I am nonplussed! Do
you believe in Asia Minor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of Asia Minor?” said I, interrupting him with
tenacity, with obstinacy; “you have related to me
a story, the parties to which interest me strongly—I
beseech you tell me more of them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are perfectly well, I thank you,” he
replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not inquire after their health, but their
fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! what has become of them? Yes, I comprehend;”
then looking at me with an air of mockery,
and laughing loudly, he continued, “as they have,
like us, a habit of chatting much when eating, they
breakfast near by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How! What!” I exclaimed, “those people at
the fountain of the priest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly. You now discover that you are no
diviner. The alledged confectioner, the lemonade
seller, is no other than my friend, Ferdinand Laperre,
our Christian martyr; and his companion, by
you so lightly qualified as a chambermaid, or a
countess without prejudices, is Baïla, the ex-favorite
of Djezzar, the pacha of Shivas; Baïla, the Mingrelian,
the rose of Incour, the dove in the talons of
the hawk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After having inflicted this mockery upon me,
which was doubtless well merited, my friend determined
finally to finish the story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having arrived in Paris, events of a more vulgar
nature than those which had signalized their sojourn
in Shivas, proved the young Frenchman and the
Mingrelian. Their money gave out. The ornaments,
presents from Djezzar, which the odalisk had
carried off in her flight, were, most of them, false.
Pachas even are no longer to be trusted. Ferdinand
must, above every thing, seek for a lucrative employment.
He entered the royal printing office as a
proof-reader of Oriental works. This resource being
insufficient for the wants of the household, Baïla
sought also to be useful. Having never handled a
needle, she could not become a seamstress or an
embroideress, or a dressing-maid, or a female companion.
She has a charming voice, and might, at a
pinch, challenge all the Italian, French, and other
singers, in warbling and trilling; but understanding
none of the European languages, she could only sing
Arabian <span class='it'>mouals</span> or Turkish <span class='it'>gazels</span>. Fortunately
she dances also; and dancing is a language spoken
and understood in all countries. She now figures in
the ballet corps of the opera, where she is remarkable
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
for her lightness, her mildness, and her modesty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As my illustrious friend finished his recital, we
saw Ferdinand Laperre and his handsome companion
walking arm-in-arm toward the Butard. Now,
better informed, I admired the rare beauty of the
Mingrelian, and the wonderful and graceful suppleness
of her figure. My eyes were directed curiously
toward the lower extremities of the ex-consular
cadet, to examine the form and dimensions of his
feet, so as to verify one of the details of this history.
I found them much as usual. He had doubtless confided
to Baïla the connection of friendship existing
between him and my companion, for when we again
met, she made him a slight wave of the hand, saying,
“<span class='it'>Bojour mocha</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Salem-Alai-k</span>,” replied my illustrious traveler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saluted her profoundly.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY HENRY GILES.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mere capacity in man of perceiving sound,
renders the musical element a necessity in nature
and in life. Discord, as a permanent state, is as inconceivable
as a permanent state of chaos. The
combinations of sounds, therefore, in the audible
creation, if not all in detail musical, are pervaded by
the musical element: No ear is insensible to the
music of the air in the branches of a tree; to the
groaning of it in the hollow cave—to its whistle in
the grass, or to its spirit-voices in a stormy night
around the dwelling. No ear is insensible to the
trickling melody of the stream, to the deep song of
the river—to the solemn anthem of the torrent, to
the eternal harmonies of the ocean. Birds are peculiarly
the musicians of the animal world. But how
skillful and how rich their music is, we must learn,
not from the printed page, but in the sunny
grove. Though other creatures have not, as birds,
the gift of song, yet are they not unmusical, and
have their parts in the mighty orchestra of living
nature. Musical sounds are grateful to the sense—and
all beings that hear listen to them, enjoy them,
and need them. In music man has a common
medium of sympathy with his fellow animals. The
charger prances to the sounds that swell the heart
of his master—for he, too, has a heart which they
can enter and dilate. A melody can soothe the lion’s
rage. The elephant treads delighted to the measure
of the band. The dog bays gladness to the shepherd’s
flute. The cow stands in placid rapture while
the milk-maid sings. Man is scarcely ever so rude
as to be beyond the reach of music. It was a myth,
containing as much truth as beauty, that feigned
Apollo with his lyre as the early tamer of wild men.
If music is the first influence which the race feels,
it is also the first which the individual feels. The
infant opens its intelligence and love to the mother’s
song as much as to the mother’s face. The voice,
even more than the look, is the primitive awakener
of the intellect and heart. Every mother ought to
sing. A song will outlive all sermons in the memory.
Let memories that begin life have songs that last for
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a mere sensation, music has power. A little
maid I have known, who would sit on her cricket
by her father’s knee until he had read the whole of
Christobel—of which she did not know the meaning
of a line. It was melodious to her ear, and merely
in its music there was fascination to her infant spirit.
The songs which primitive people sing—in which
they have their best social interchange, are frequently
poor in diction and bald in sentiment. It is
the music that gives the words a life; and this life
can transfuse energetic inspiration into the meanest
words. Early melodies are, of necessity, most
simple. They are the instincts seeking to put themselves
into measured sound—yet with little to fill the
ear, and less to reach the mind. Nevertheless, they
are good for the mind and pleasant to the ear. A
rude musical sensation is of value; of how much
more value is a refined musical sensation. But a
musical sensation is of its very nature a refined one.
It is among the purest of sensations. It may, indeed,
be associated with coarse and base emotions.
This, however, is not in itself. It is in the imagination
or the word-music simply, as music presents
nothing to the sense that is either coarse or base.
The conception is from the mind to music, not from
music to the mind. Speaking of music as a sensation,
I speak relatively—for to man there is no music
without soul. In music soul and sense both mingle—and
become <span class='it'>one</span> in its inspired sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the least part of music is the mere sensation.
It is not on the ear but on the heart that its finest
spirit dwells. <span class='it'>There</span> are the living chords which it
puts in motion, and in whose vibration it has the
echoes of its tones. The heart, after all, is the instrument
with which the true musician has to deal. He
must understand that from its lowest note to the top
of its compass. The true test of music is the amount
of feeling it contains. The true criterion of a love
for music is the capacity to appreciate feeling in
music. Music properly is the language of emotion.
It is the language of the heart. Its grammar, its
rhetoric, its eloquence, its oratory, is of the heart.
The evidence of its power is in the calm or the
quivering pulsation. Feeling in music is a memory,
a sympathy, or an impulse. Nothing can recall with
such vividness as music can a past emotion—a departed
state of mind. Words are but the history of
a by-gone thought—music is its presence. All our
profoundest feelings are in their nature lyrical.
Whatever most deeply affects us, we do, in some
way, link to tune, or they are by tune awakened.
The feelings sing of themselves, and make an orchestra
of the brain. Persons utterly incapable of putting
the simplest combination of sounds musically together,
will make melody in their hearts of the reminiscences
that strongly move them. And these will
commonly be sad, as all is that is connected with
the Past—sad, however, with various degrees of intensity—some,
but calm regrets—others, dirges and
requiems. Therefore it is that the most affecting
melodies belong to the Past—to the past in the life
of a man—to the past in the life of a nation. Such
melodies come not from prosperity or power. They
come from those who have missed a history, or
whose history is over. Such melodies are voices
of sadness—the yearnings over what might have
been but was not—the regret for what has been but
will never be again. And thus, too, it is with the
most affecting eloquence. That which agitates the
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>
breast with force resistless is the word which is
fraught with the passions of its sorrow. Life in
power is Action—Life in memory is elegy or eloquence.
A nation, like a man, dreams its life again—and
until life is gone or changed it soliloquizes or
sings its dreams. The music of memory lives in
every man’s experience; and the excellence of it is,
that it binds itself only to our better feelings. It is
the excellence of our nature, also, that only such
feelings have spontaneous memories. The worst
man does not willingly recall his bad feelings: and
if he did, he could not wed them to a melody. Hatred,
malice—vengeance, envy, have, to be sure,
their proper expressions in the lyric drama, but of
themselves they are not musical, and by themselves
they could not be endured. It is not so with the kind
emotions. They are in themselves a music—and
memory delights in the sweetness of their intonations.
Love, affection, friendship, patriotism, pity,
grief, courage—whatever generously swells the
heart or tenderly subdues it—or purely elevates it—are,
of themselves, of their own attuning and accordant
graciousness, of a musical inspiration. With
what enchantment will a simple strain pierce the
silence of the breast, and in every note break the
slumber of a thousand thoughts. It is a positive enchantment.
Faces long in the clay bloom as they
did in youth. An inward ear is opened through the
outward—and voices of other times are speaking—and
words which you had heard before come to
your soul, and they are pleasant in this illusive echo.
Your spirit is lost in the flight of days, and insensible
to the interval of distance; it is back in other hours,
and dwells in other scenes. Such are the mysterious
linkings by which music interlaces itself with
our feelings—and so becomes an inseparable portion
of our sympathy. But sympathy exists only when
music answers to the spirit. Give not a merry carol
to a heavy heart; although you may give a grave
strain to a light one. Music, as rightly used, is, as
some one calls it, “the medicine of an afflicted
mind.” Joy is heightened by exultant strains, but
grief is eased only by low ones. “A sweet, sad
measure” is the balm of a wounded spirit. Music
lightens toil. The sailor pulls more cheerily for his
song: and even the slave feels in singing that he is a
man. But, in other forms of labor, we miss in our
country the lyric feeling. Most of our work is done
in silence. We hear none of those songs at the
milking hour, which renders that hour in Europe so
rich in pastoral and poetical associations. We hear
no ploughman’s whistle ringing over the field with a
buoyant hilarity. We have no chorusses of reapers,
and no merry harvest-feasts. But if such things can
not be naturally, it is vain to wish for them—and it
may be even useless to mention them. Better things,
perhaps, are in their place—grave meditation and
manly thought—and I merely allude to them as elements
that accord pleasingly with certain modes of
life in countries to whose habits and history they
are native. Music in social intercourse is a fine
awakener of sympathies, and a fine uniter of them.
A violin or a piano is often not less needed to soothe
the ruffled spirit of a company, than the harp of David
was to calm down the fiend in the turbulent
breast of Saul. Music, as we see in the customs of
all nations, is used as an antidote to the sense of
danger, as well as a stimulus to the passion of combat.
And as embattled hosts move with measured
tramp to the field of death, music is the magic that
is trusted to charm away fear or to call up courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Largely are men indebted even to the music of
ballads and of songs. Difficult it would be to measure
the good which such music has done to mankind.
To multitudes in days of yore songs were the
only literature, and by the bards they had all their
learning. Songs were their history; their romance;
their tragedy; their comedy; their fire-side eloquence,
giving utterance and perpetuity to sacred
affections, and to noble thoughts—and keeping alive
a spirit of humanity in both the vassal and the lord.
Men have not yet ceased to need such influences, nor
have such influences lost their power. They still add
purer brightness to the joys of the young—and are a
solace to the memory of age. They are still bonds
of a generous communion. They banish strangeness
from the rich man’s hall: they add refinement to the
rich man’s banquet: they are joy in the poor man’s
holyday, they express lovingness in the poor man’s
feast. What so aids beneficent nature as such music
does, to remove barbarism and to inspire kindness?
How dear amidst all the toils of earth are the songs
which were music to our infant ears—the songs of our
hearth and of our home—the songs which were our
childhood’s spells, a blessedness upon our mother’s
lips, a rapture and delight! What solaces the exile,
while it saddens him? What is it that from the
ends of ocean turns him with wistful imagination to
the star which overhangs his father-land? What is
it that brings the tear to his eye, and the memory
of other days, and the vision in the far-off west;
that annihilates years and distance, and gives him
back his country, and gives him back his youth?
Song—inspired song—domestic song—national song—song
that carries ideal enthusiasm into rudest
places—with many a tale of marvel and magnanimity—of
heroism in the soldier, and sanctity in
the saint—of constancy in love, and of bravery in
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Man is a social being. Unselfish society is the
harmony of humanity: loving interchange is the
music of life; the music which lifts the attuned soul
above discordant passions and petty cares—and song
is the voice in which that music breathes. These
are the strains that have memories in them of all
that true souls deem worthy of life or death—the
purities of their homes, the sacredness of their altars,
the hopes of their posterity—all for which martyrs
suffer—all for which patriots bleed—all that give
millions a single wish and a single will—all that
make the cry of liberty as the trump of judgment,
and the swords of freemen as the bolts of heaven.
Glorious names, and glorious deeds, and honorable
feelings, are always allied to the lyric spirit. The
independence of a country may seem to be utterly
lost: the ruin of a nation may appear decided: indeed,
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
its external destiny may be accomplished; but
the character of a people is never absolutely degraded
until the lyric fire is dead upon the altar, and
the lyric voice is heard no longer in the temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music is not exhausted in expressing feeling,
though some persons are so constituted as not beyond
this to understand or to enjoy it. But music of
more profound combination is not, on this account,
without meaning and without value. The higher
forms of music, like the higher forms of poetry,
must, of course, if tested by mere instinct, seem remote
and complicated. Music, too, is susceptible of
more multiplied combinations than poetry; and,
without the restraints of arbitrary signs and definite
ideas, can expatiate in the region of pure imagination.
In the true sense of the word, it is infinite.
Not bound to form, not bound to color, not bound
to speech, it is as unlimited as the capacity of the
soul to exist in undefinable states of emotional being.
And into these it can throw the soul with inconceivable
rapidity of change. The great master of
even a single instrument appears, indeed, a wizard.
He seems, in truth, to be the only artist to whom the
designation of wizard can with any correctness be
applied. Men of other genius may be creators, but
the musician is the wizard. His instrument is a
talisman. It is full of conjurations—out from it he
draws his witchery; he puts his spell upon all
around him; he chains them in the slavery of delight;
and he is the only despot that rules over willing
captives. No other power on the imagination
is so complete—so uncontrollable. The fiction or
the poem you can lay aside; the picture or statue
moves you but calmly; the actor is at the mercy of
an accident; the orator may fail, by reason of your
opposition to his sentiments or opposition to his person;
but the musician draws you from every thing
which can counteract his charm, and once within
his circle you have no escape from his power. Emotional
conceptions—solemn, gay, pathetic, impassioned—are
as souls in all his sounds. But in the
case of an executive musician, the art seems incarnate
in the artist. We associate the personality of
the artist with the effects of his art. We are not yet
within the limitless domain of imaginative music.
The great instrumentalist is, indeed, a wizard—a
cunning necromancer; but he is before us while he
works his spells, and though we cannot resist the
enchanter we <span class='it'>behold</span> him. In a great composer there
is a higher potency, and it is one that is not seen.
The action of his spirit on our spirits, though exercised
by means of intermediate agents, is yet that of
an invisible incantation. The great composer is an
imperial magician—the sovereign of genii and the
master of wizards. He is a Prospero, and <span class='it'>Music</span> is
his <span class='it'>Enchanted Island</span>. The creative musician, and
the region in which he dwells, can have no analogy
more correct than that presented to us in Shakspeare’s
extraordinary play of “The Tempest.”
There we have the loud-resounding sea; at one moment
the sun bright in the clear sky, at another
hidden by the mist or breaking through the blood-red
cloud; now the heavens are full of stars, and in
an instant they are thick with gloom; the elements
gather into masses, they clash together, and the
thunder and the waves fill up the chorus. Then the
day dawns softly, and the morning breaks into summer
songs. Caves are there and pleasant dells; solitudes
are there, dark and lonely; spots beautiful as
well as terrible; barren and blasted heaths, where
goblins hold their revels; and labyrinthian walks,
where sweet-hearts, not unwilling, lose themselves
and linger. The earth, the atmosphere, shore,
stream, grove, are filled with preternatural movements,
with sweet voices and strange sounds. There
are Ariel-melodies, there are Caliban groanings;
there are the murmurings of manly passions, and the
whisperings of maiden-love; there are <a id='bach'></a>Bacchanalian
jovialities, high and mysterious monologues, fanciful
and fairy-ditties, the full swellings of excited
hearts, and the choral transports of all nature, made
living and made lyrical. But the Prospero who rules
in this island, dwells in a lonely cell, and yet commands
all the voices of the universe to do his bidding.
Have I not, by this analogy, described a grand
imaginative composer? Without intending it, I have
described Beethoven. I speak, I admit, only as one
of the appreciating vulgar—as one of the impressible
ignorant; I am able only to express a sensation, not
to pronounce a judgment. In listening to Beethoven’s
music there is a delight, for which, no doubt, the
learned artist can give a reason. I know nothing of
art, and with me the listening is an untutored, a wild,
an almost savage joy or sorrow, or a mixture of emotions
that cannot be defined. The music of Beethoven,
if I can judge from the little that I have heard of it,
is <span class='it'>unearthly</span>; but the unearthliness of this music is
of a compound nature. Like Spenser’s, Beethoven’s
imagination is unearthly; and, like Spenser’s, it is
unearthly in the supernaturally grand and beautiful.
Like Milton’s imagination, also, Beethoven’s is unearthly;
but here it is unearthly in the mysterious
and the solemn. The union of these elements in the
wholeness of Beethoven’s genius, have given to us
that singular, that most original music, which seems
to belong to the ideal region, which eastern fancy
has peopled with genii and <a id='fair'></a>fairies. What a wonderful
thing is a symphony of Beethoven’s! But who
can describe it, in either its construction or its effects?
You might as well attempt to describe, by set
phrases, the raptures of St. Paul or the visions of the
Apocalypse. It always seems the utterance of a
mighty trance, of a mysterious dream, of a solemn
ecstacy. The theme, even the most simple—so simple
that a child, as it might appear, could have
fashioned it, is one, however, that genius of a marvelous
peculiarity only could have discovered—a
genius that worked and lived amidst the most ideal
analogies by which sounds are related to emotions.
And this unearthly theme is thrown at once into an
ocean of orchestral harmony, and this orchestral
harmony is as unearthly as the theme. Thrown
upon the orchestra it seems to break, to divide itself,
to scatter itself upon the waves of an enchanted sea,
in a multitude of melodies. It seems as a tune
played by a spirit-minstrel, on a summer night, in
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>
the glade of a lonely wood, to which all the genii of
music answer, in chorusses of holy, sad, enchanting
modulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of Mozart! What shall we say of him—of
Mozart, less only than Beethoven in those strains
which linger amidst remote associations, but versatile
beyond most composers in the romance and reality
of the comic and the tragic in actual life. If
ever a genius lived with which all its work was
play, that genius was the genius of Mozart. Constantly
he made the merest play of genius. At ten
years old he could astonish the most critical of musical
audiences in Paris, and before their rapture had
approached within many <a id='degree'></a>degrees of moderation, he
would be romping in the crowd of his companions.
Nor was it different in his maturity. He could compose
a piece, in which he was himself to take a part.
He would distribute the score, perfectly arranged for
the several performers. As they played, he would
turn page after page over along with them, always
in the spirit of the music and its harmony; but the
emperor, looking over his shoulder, could see that
not a note had he written down. Mozart seemed to
combine in his genius all the sweetness of Italy with
all the depth of Germany. But on these themes I
have no authority to speak. All I can say is, that
what I have heard of his compositions, and most of
what I have learned of his life, have led me to think
of him with admiration as a musician, and with affection
as a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music, it is sometimes said, is not an intellectual
art. <span class='it'>What does this mean?</span> Does it mean that
music employs no intellect in the artist, and excites
none in the hearer? The assertion in both cases is
untrue. Music, as a study, must, I think, be profoundly
intellectual. In the oldest universities it has
always had a place among the abstract sciences.
But, considered as an enjoyment—considered in
relation to the hearer—we should first need to settle
what we understand by an intellectual enjoyment.
To work a problem in algebra, or to examine a question
of theology, may be each an intellectual pleasure;
but the pleasure, it is manifest, is, in each
case very different. These both, it is true, agree in
taxing the <span class='it'>reasoning</span> faculty; but is nothing intellectual
but that which formally taxes this faculty?
Is nothing intellectual but that which involves syllogism—but
that which implies demonstration or induction?
Prayer is not intellectual, if we identify
intellectuality with logic; and if we do this, it is
<span class='it'>not</span> intellectual to feel the merits of a picture, but
peculiarly so to understand the proportions of its
frame. According to such a theory, it is intellectual
to analyze with Aristotle, but it is not
so to burn and to soar with Plato. To speculate
with Jeremy Bentham is intellectual, but it is not
so to be enraptured by the divine song of Milton.
Assertions which lead to such conclusions
must be radically false. Whatever puts man’s spiritual
powers into action, is intellectual. The <span class='it'>kind</span>
of action engaged will, of course, be ever according
to the subject and the object. The intellectuality of
a statesman is not that of a bard; the intellectuality
which concocts an act of parliament, is not that
which composes a “Song of the Bell.” Music is
neither inductive nor raciotionative. It is an art;
that is, it is an inward law realised in outward fact.
Such is all art. In this music agrees with all arts,
for all arts are but the outward realities of inward
laws. But some of these are for utility, others for
delight. Music is of those arts which spring from
the desire for enjoyment and gratify it. It bears the
soul away into the region of the infinite, and moves
it with conceptions of exhaustless possibilities of
beauty. If ideas, feelings, imaginations, are intellectual,
then is music; if that which can excite, combine,
modify, elevate—memories, feelings, imagination—is
intellectual, then music is intellectual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An art which, like music, is the offspring of passion
and emotion, could not but take a dramatic
form. The lyrical drama, secular and sacred, civilized
humanity could not but produce. Nothing is
more natural than that the gayety and grief of the
heart should seek the intense and emphatic expression
which music can afford. It would, indeed, be
extraordinary if a creature like man—so covetous of
excitement, so desirous of varying his sensations—did
not press into his service, wherever it could be
used, an art which has no other equal to it for excitement
and variety. The opera, both comic and
tragic, is a genuine production of this desire. The
burlesque, the odd, the merry, the absurd, and, still
more, pity, love, jealousy, vengeance, despair, have
their music in the rudest states of society; it is only
in the order of things that they should in cultivated
states of society have a cultivated music. Such
music, as a matter of course, would connect itself
with a story, a plot, with incident, character, scenery,
costume, and catastrophe. It would thus become
dramatic. Thus it has become; and as such, it has
a range as ample as that of human life, as deep as
human passions, as versatile as the human fancy and
the human will. Hence we have the opera. The
opera is that form which the drama assumed among a
people musically organized—among a people whose
love of music was, therefore, intense, constitutional
and expansive. But no art remains within the limits
of its native space, and the opera is now as extensive
as civilization; as extensive, certainly, as modern
civilization. The ballad is the first comedy
or tragedy. There are germs in the words of the
ballet for the genius of Shakspeare—there are germs
in the air of it for the genius of Rossini. Many object
to the opera. First, they say, it is expensive.
All our amusements are expensive—expensive as
they ought not to be—expensive as they would not
be with a higher and a purer social culture. Artistic
amusements are expensive, especially, by the want
of taste, which hinders the many from sharing in
them—by the want of taste, which makes <span class='it'>expense</span> itself
distinction. True taste coincides with true feeling;
true feeling delights in beauty, as it delights in
goodness, for its own sake; and true feeling being
wide as nature and humanity, the more widely its delight
is shared the greater its own enjoyment. Were
there among the people a diffusive taste for elevated
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
music, we cannot but feel that music could be cheap
as well as noble. But, secondly, many say that the
opera is unnatural. It is absurd, they quizzically aver,
that persons should sing their love-talk, their madness,
their despair, etc., and grieve or laugh, and die or be
married, in sharps or flats, in major or minor. And
yet, this is exactly what nature does. Nature sings
all its stronger emotions. The moment expression
becomes excited it has rhythm—it has cadence; and
the tune of Rossini is nearer to instinct than the
blank verse of Shakspeare. Who will say that
genuine passion is not in this wonderful blank verse?
But who is it that could impromptu speak it? So in
the tones and harmonies of music. In both nature
is carried into the region of art, out from the region
of the actual; and within the region of art the musical
utterance of nature is no more strange than the
poetical utterance of nature. The moral view of the
opera I do not here pretend to deal with. My purpose
is to speak on music as an element of social culture;
and it is not beyond the range of possibility that
beautiful truths can be united dramatically to beautiful
tones. If they cannot, then society has an immense
loss; and if a noble story cannot be told by
music—cannot be told to a moral purpose, then music
ceases to be an art, as it has always been considered
as associated with the divinest impulses of
our nature. The abuses of which the opera is susceptible,
are the abuses of which every form of art
is susceptible. The artist stands—he has ever stood—upon
a point between the human and divine. He
may carry his art into gross sensualities of the human,
or into lofty spiritualities of the divine. With
the purification of society we shall have the purification
of art and of the artist; and, therefore, I can see
no reason why the opera might not be made effective
in the best culture of social humanity. The lyrical
expression of humanity is not less human than it is
religious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sacred lyrical drama, or oratorio, seems to be
a remnant of the old mysteries. In those old mysteries
a scriptural subject was exhibited to the people
in a theatrical manner. The scriptural subject is all
that remains of the old mystery in the modern oratorio.
Stage, scenery, costume, have departed,
and music takes their place. Music, therefore, in
the oratorio, must, by its own power, indicate character,
sentiment, passion; it must unite grandeur
and diversity with unity of spirit; it must unite them
with unity of expression. Yet even the oratorio has
not escaped objection. But, if it has been wrongly
attacked, it has been as unwisely defended. What,
it is triumphantly asked, can inspire deeper devotion,
more fervent piety, than the sacred composition of
Handel? The mistake of the artiste on this side of
the question, has its only measure in the mistake of
the ascetic on the other. The strains, even of Handel,
may be in unison with the highest and purest aspirations
of the mind; but, in his divinest dramas, they
are not of themselves—devotion. But, if high music
confers a pleasure that harmonizes with the mind’s
best faculties; if it prepares the mind’s best faculties
for their best exercise; if by lifting the mind up into
the sphere of great emotions from that of mean ones;
if by withdrawing it from attention to selfish desires,
it carries it into lofty thought, music exercises for
the mind, even in the temple, a sacred power, though
its power should yet only be artistic. No mind,
for instance, can be in a low or degraded condition,
while it is in sympathy with the pure and delectable
genius of Haydn. No mind can have communed
with him through his oratorio of the “Creation,”
can have drunk in its liquid melodies—its gladdening
hymns of praise—its soft and heart-soothing airs—its
songs, which seem to sparkle with the light which
they celebrate—with the dew that bathed first the
flowers of Paradise—with its anthems of holy exultation,
such as the sons of God might have shouted—with
the whole breathing in every part as it does—with
the young soul of goodness and beauty—no
mind, I say, can be in such communion, and for the
time be otherwise than transported beyond all that
can belittle or defile. But Handel excites a profounder
sentiment. He is not so cheerful as Haydn.
He could not be; for this he is too massive and
austere. He does not, like Haydn, lead the mind out
to nature, he turns it in upon itself. Not loveliness,
but mysteries make the spirit of his music. We find in
Haydn the picturesqueness and the buoyancy of the
Catholic worship; in Handel, the sombre, the inquiring,
the meditative thoughtfulness of the Protestant
faith. By Haydn’s “Creation” we are
charmed and elated; by Handel’s “Messiah” we are
moved with an overcoming sense of awe and power.
Though nothing can surpass the sweetness of Handel’s
melodies, yet interspersed amidst such masses
of harmony, they seem like hymns amidst the billows
of the ocean, or songs among the valleys of
the Alps. Handel’s genius was made for a subject
that placed him in the presence of eternity and the
universe. His moods and movements are too vast
for the moods and movements of common interests
or the common heart. They require the spaces of
the worlds. They require interests coincident with
man’s destiny, and with man’s duration. Though
Handel’s airs in the “Messiah” are of sweetest and
gentlest melody, they have majesty in their sweetness
and their gentleness. We can associate them with
no event lower than that with which they are connected.
In such tones we can conceive the Saviour’s
birth celebrated in the song of angels; in such tones
we can fancy the Redeemer welcomed in hosannas
by those who ignorantly dragged him afterward to
Calvary. And then the plaintiveness of Handel in the
“Messiah,” has its true horizon only in that which
girds the immortal. It is not simply plaintive, it is
mysteriously awful. It is not a grief for earthly man, it
is a grief for him who bore the griefs of all men—for
Him who carried our sorrows—who was wounded
for our transgressions—who was bruised for our
iniquities, who was oppressed and afflicted, and who
bore the chastisement of our peace. It is not a grief
in which any common spirit dare complain. It is
fit only for Him who had sorrows to which no man’s
sorrows were like. It does not cause us to pity, but
to tremble. It does not move us to weeping, because
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
there lie beneath it, thoughts which are too deep for
tears. And then, in unison with this dread and
solemn pathos, is the subdued but mighty anguish
of the general harmony. When the victory is proclaimed—the
victory over the grave—the victory
over death—the victory in which mortality is swallowed
up of life—we are lost in the glory of a superhuman
chorus; our imagination breaks all local
bounds; we fancy all the elements of creation, all
glorified and risen men, all the hosts of Heaven’s
angels united in this exultant anthem. Handel truly
is the Milton of music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grandest office of music, however, is that in
which, no doubt, it originated—that in which, early,
it had its first culture; in which, latest, it has its
best—I mean its office in religion. In the sanctuary
it was born, and in the service of God it arose with
a sublimity with which it could never have been
inspired in the service of pleasure. More assimilated
than any other art to the spiritual nature of man, it
affords a medium of expression the most congenial
to that nature. Compared with tones that breathe
out from a profound, a spiritually musical soul, how
poor is any allegory which painting can present, or
that symbol can indicate. The soul is invisible; its
emotions admit no more than itself of shape or limitation.
The religious emotions cannot always have
even verbal utterance. They often seek an utterance
yet nearer to the infinite; and such they find in
music. You cannot delineate a feeling—at most you
can but suggest it by delineation. But in music you
can by intonation directly give the feeling. Thus
related to the unseen soul, music is a voice for faith,
which is itself the realization of things not seen.
And waiting as the soul is amidst troubles and toils,
looking upward from the earth, and onward out of
time, for a better world or a purer life, in its believing
and glad expectancy, music is the voice of its
hope. In the depression and despondency of conviction;
in the struggles of repentance; in the consolations
and rejoicing of forgiveness; in the wordless
calm of internal peace, music answers to the
mood, and soothingly breaks the dumbness of the
heart. For every charity that can sanctify and bless
humanity, music has its sacred measures; and well
does goodness merit the richest harmony of sound,
that is itself the richest harmony of heaven. Sorrow,
also, has its consecrated melody. The wounded
spirit and the broken heart are attempered and
assuaged by the murmurings of divine song. A
plaintive hymn soothes the departing soul. It mingles
with weeping in the house of death. It befits the
solemn ritual of the grave. The last supper was
closed with a hymn, and many a martyr for Him
who went from that supper to his agony, made their
torture jubilant in songs of praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An essay equal to the subject on the vicissitudes
and varieties of sacred music, would be one of the
most interesting passages in the history of art. In
their long wanderings to the land of promise, sacred
music was among the hosts of Israel; and in that
great temple of nature, floored by the desert, and
roofed by the sky, they chanted the song of Miriam
and of Moses. It was in their Sabbath meetings—it
resounded with the rejoicings of their feasts, and
with the gladness of their jubilees. When Solomon
built a house to the Lord, it was consecrated with
cymbals, and psalteries, and harps, with the sounds
of trumpets, and the swell of voices. As long as the
temple stood, music hallowed its services; and that
music must have been supremely grand which suited
the divine poetry of the inspired and kingly lyrist.
Israel was scattered—the temple was no more.
Silence and desolation dwelt in the place of the
sanctuary. Zion heard no longer the anthems of
her Levites. A new word that was spoken first in
Jerusalem had gone forth among the nations; and
that too had its music. At first it was a whisper
among the <a id='low'></a>lowly in the dwellings of the poor.
Stealthily it afterward was murmured in the palace
of the Cæsars. In the dead night, in the depths of
the catacombs, it trembled in subdued melodies filled
with the love of Jesus. At length the grand cathedral
arose, and the stately spire; courts and arches echoed,
and pillars shook with the thunder of the majestic
organ, and choirs, sweetly attuned, joined their voices
in all the moods and measures of the religious heart,
in its most exalted, most profound, most intense experience
put into lyrical expression. I know that
piety may reject, may repel this form of expression,
still these sublime ritual harmonies cannot but give
the spirit that sympathizes with them, the sense of
a mightier being. But sacred music has power
without a ritual. In the rugged hymn, which connects
itself, not alone with immortality, but also
with the memory of brave saints, there is power.
There is power in the hymn in which our father’s
joined. Grand were those rude psalms which once
arose amidst the solitudes of the Alps. Grand were
those religious songs, sung in brave devotion by the
persecuted Scotch, in the depths of their moors and
their glens. The <a id='hun'></a>hundredth psalm, rising in the fullness
of three thousand voices up into the clear sky,
broken among rocks, prolonged and modulated
through valleys, softened over the surface of mountain-guarded
lakes, had a grandeur and a majesty,
contrasted with which mere art is poverty and
meanness. And while thus reflecting on sacred
music, we think with wonder on the Christian
Church—on its power and on its compass. Less
than nineteen centuries ago, its first hymn was sung
in an upper chamber of Jerusalem; and those who
sung it were quickly scattered. And now the Christian
hymn is one that never ceases—one that is heard
in every tongue; and the whisper of that upper
chamber is now a chorus that fills the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music is an essential element in social life and
social culture, and our times have few better movements
than the increasing introduction of vocal
music into popular education. The higher kinds of
music might be included in all the higher kinds of
education for men as well as for women. Milton so
teaches in his great tractate; and so the Greeks
practiced, in whose training no faculty was wasted
or overlooked. The music which is now most
wanted, however, is music for the common heart.
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
If education will give us the taste for such music,
and give us the music, it will confer upon us a
benefit, a blessing. It is not desired that music in
the home, or in the friendly circle, should never
wander out of the sphere of the home or the friendly
circle, only let not these spheres of feeling be without
any strains peculiarly suitable to themselves. Let
the theatre have its music; let the camp have its
music; let the dance-room have its music; let the
church have its music; but let the home and the
friendly gathering also have their music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have for the cultivated, music of rare powers
and in great abundance; but we need a music for
the people—and no music can be music for the
people, but that which answers to simple and direct
emotion. It is a most important need. The music
of the opera, granting it were ever so pure, and had
no resistance to encounter, can be had only in cities,
and can never reach the scattered masses of the population.
The music of the oratorio must have a limitation
even still more restricted. Popular music
must be domestic, social music. We have it not;
therefore we are a silent people, and our writings
have no lyrical inspirations. The finer and deeper
elements of popular life have no true medium of exposition.
These subtle, delicate, wordless idealities
of the soul, which the rudest have, are without music;
that alone, which can take them from the confining
bosom, and give them to the vital air. Our rural life
is gladdened by no song—is the subject of no song;
and our social life is almost as silent as the rural.
National music we have none: and our political
songs are, generally, a shame to <a id='dog'></a>doggerel, and a libel
upon tune. Complaining on the want of social and
domestic music, will not, I am aware, supply it; and
yet it is no less a want. We want it on the summer’s
evening, when our work is done, to rest the
spirit as we rest the body; and while the eye is filled
with visible beauty, to bring the soul into harmony
with invisible goodness. We want it in the winter’s
night, by the winter fire, to cheer us while the hours
pass, and to humanize in amusing us. We want it
in our friendly re-unions, not for delight alone, but
also for charity and peace, to exclude the demon of
idle or evil speaking, and to silence the turbulence
of polemical or political discussion. We want it in
our churches. Christianity is the home-feeling and
the social-feeling made perfect. The music of it
should be the home-feeling and the social-feeling
consecrated. As it is, our Protestant churches at
least have either a drawling psalmody with the monotony
of a lullaby, or they have patches of selections
that want unity, appropriateness, or meaning.
A music is wanted in our Protestant churches such
as Christianity ought to have; a music, simple yet
grand—varied but not capricious—gladsome with
holy joy, not with irreverent levity, not sentimental,
yet tender, solemn but not depressing—not intolerant
to the beauties of art, and yet not scornful of popular
feeling. If a true and natural taste for music should
spring up and be cultivated through the country, not
in cities only, but in every village and district, it
would be an auspicious phenomenon. It would be
a most vital and a most humanizing element in social
life. It would break the dullness of our homes; it
would brighten the hour of our meetings; would enliven
our hospitality, and it would sublime our worship.
“Let who that will make the laws of a people,”
some one said, “but let me make their songs;” to
which a great and patriotic composer might add, Let
who that will supply the words of a people’s songs,
if I shall be allowed to give these words to music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the Marquis of Santa-Cruz with a
hundred sail was steering from Lisbon to Tercera,
bent upon reaching that island before the French
fleet, and moreover settling it in his own mind to
hang the Viceroy de Torrevedros, (who was at that
moment taking wine with De Chaste to their mutual
longevity,) for sticking to the landless and luckless
King Anthony of Portugal, in preference to his own
master Philip the Second, sometimes called the Prudent,
but by the Protestants, whom he roasted and
otherwise ill-treated, the Demon of the South.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Señor Inique’s vessel was the Doblon, and our
acquaintance Don Pedro’s the Pez-de-mar, but on
the day designated, the two maîtres-de-camp dined
together in the Doblon, besides whom were at table
some half dozen cavaliers of more or less note. At
the close of the meal, Sir Pedro said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen all, this is a day I never let pass
without thought of the brave man whose head fell
ten years ago this noon, at Brussels. I ask a <span class='it'>pater</span>
of the company here present for the rest of his soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you mean Count Egmont,” answered one,
“there never was truer knight. I was near him at
the time of his death, and believe him to have been
as loyal as you or I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A doubtful comparison,” cried another, laughing,
“since you question the king’s justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By no means,” returned the Constable of Castile.
“The king acknowledged as much himself.
I was present when the news arrived, and he said
with his usual smile, ‘These two salmon heads are
better off than three-score heads of frogs!’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and the French ambassador wrote to court,
‘I have seen a head fall which has twice made
France quake.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the constable, “I was but a stripling
at the time, but I well remember how the count led
his lances at St. Quentin. There was not a—hush!
what’s that?” he stopped suddenly and asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?” demanded most of his audience, who
had heard nothing but the breaking of Don Pedro’s
glass upset by his elbow. Perhaps Don Pedro, sitting
next, was the only other who heard the smothered
cry from a partition behind their host, for
Don Inique’s face was as usual inflexible as a mask,
and Padilh, turning to the constable, said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I interrupted you. You were saying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Count Egmont rode so gallantly, there was not
a man in the army had seen the like before; it was
a ballad of the campeador acted to the life. Even
the king, when he came down from the Escurial,
praised his bravery, and afterward presented him a
sword, upon which was engraved ‘St. Quentin.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constable may have repeated the last word
to satisfy a doubt in his mind, but if so he was disappointed
in his purpose, for no response came from
the partition, although a momentary silence followed
the close of the sentence. I mention this little incident
because it was the prelude to a singular conversation
between the two camp-masters, the next
morning, on board the Pez-de-mar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot be mistaken, Padilh,” said the other, in
his starched way. “You heard the exclamation
yesterday at table, and endeavored to drown it. You
saved me, sir, a pang—for which I am grateful,” he
added, with the air of a man compelled to acknowledge
a service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did my best and quickest to forestall curiosity,”
answered Sir Pedro kindly. “The Constable of
Castile is the only gentleman in the fleet who suspects
the presence of your—your—son. And that
only since yesterday; he told me as much last evening.
For your precautions in Portugal have been
effectual in keeping a knowledge of the matter even
from most of our comrades at St. Quentin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A curse fall on the name,” muttered Inique
bitterly. “It is the only touchstone his memory has,
and at its utterance nothing but force can stay his
screams. God pity me: I act it all over in mind
whenever the boy cries out as he did on the field.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Padilh knew his associate well enough to disguise
what <a id='com'></a>commiseration he felt, and without noticing
the interruption continued—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus, señor, your secret is safe still; for as you
may readily believe, the constable got as little information
from my tongue as by his own at table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think he pronounced the name with design?”
cried the maître-de-camp, his brows contracting.
“If I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned honest Don Pedro decidedly,
“the constable is a man of worth, and would pry
into no one’s affairs systematically. But his chief
defect is a tendency to say or do whatever comes
into his head, and that he falls into difficulty less
often is perhaps owing more to luck than consideration
on his part. Don’t you remember hearing the
answer he made his Holiness, while a mere lad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” absently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” persisted the knight, regardless of the
doubtful attention of his auditor, and moved by a
good-natured wish to lead away from the painful
topic, “the brusquerie of the whole affair made it
the talk at court; where were you that you failed to
hear it? The constable was sent to congratulate his
Holiness on his accession to St. Peter’s chair, but
the Pope taking umbrage at the youth of the ambassador,
exclaimed aloud—‘What! has the King of
Spain no men in his dominions, that he sends us a
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>
face without a beard?’ Whereupon the fiery boy,
stretching himself up and stroking with forefinger
and thumb his upper lip, where a mustache should
have been but was not, said with a frown—‘Sir, had
my royal master known your Holiness measured
wisdom by a beard, he would doubtless have sent
a he-goat to honor you!’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a pause Inique said—(the capernian episode
was evidently lost upon him)—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no need of any mortal’s sympathy, Padilh,
and the man that pities me openly must answer
to my sword for it. You have done neither to my
knowledge, yet you were not far off when I struck
the boy,” (he dropped his voice here, as a weight
on the conscience will make people do.) “If you
choose to listen, the secret motives of a man who for
fifteen years has had no thought for his second child,
until moved to avenge her, because the first, an idiot,
intervened, may startle your ears, Pedro Padilh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The recital may ease your breast,” said our
knight in some surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no likelihood of what you say,” answered
Don Augustino, a shade of scorn crossing
his moody face, “and I wish it otherwise. Why I
choose you, a companion in arms, for confessor, you
will learn in time; perhaps your long friendship and
yesterday’s prompt action have their influence.
These things you witnessed or know; the mad
blows, their result, the measures I have taken to be
constantly within reach of his voice? Why? have
you, has any one, hesitated to give some cloak, some
color, to so singular a course?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each of these interrogatories, rapidly put, Sir
Pedro answered in turn by a slight token of assent;
he was about to reply more fully to the last, when
the other stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind. I know what is said. That I hide
away the living reminder of my crime from the world;
that I am remorseful, or doing penance, or else
crazed. Let them prate. Sir Pedro, by all the
saints, the boy I struck is not my son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor fellow!” thought the knight, compassionately;
“his last plea is the right one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Pedro Padilh, there was a man of good
birth and great wealth, but little or no character, or
care for character, whom I saved once from being
hanged. He was grateful, after his headlong fashion,
for the service, and in the end proposed to unite our
infant children; he had one son, and I a son and
daughter; and consolidate our joint estates. At first
my soul revolted at the suggestion; an union between
my own offspring and that of a redeemed felon, appeared
to me monstrous. But while I debated the
matter, difficulties softened. I knew better than any
one the smallness of my fortune, which extravagance
had reduced to the tatters of its former amplitude;
but of this I said nothing, and the papers were signed
in due form. That day was the last I could touch
my breast proudly, and say, ‘Here is the abode of
honor.’”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this is the soldier whose honor is held up to
the world as a pattern!” Padilh mused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still the degradation of such connection preyed
upon my mind. I wanted the money to perpetuate
the wealth of my house; but how be rid of the bad
blood? And about this time my friend went abroad,
leaving his boy in my charge. I confronted the
temptation only to be overcome in the end; sent
away my servants, and removing to the mountains
chose others; and when these were assembled, I,
myself, took occasion to call the names of the infants
before them, that there might be no mistake—<span class='it'>no
mistake</span>, you understand—as names may from what
they have been. My own boy I called—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak, Sir Augustino!” ejaculated Padilh,
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hilo de Ladron; the other—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, man!” cried the knight, rising and standing
over against the speaker, “You have made an idiot
of and imprison my own kin—the son of my half-brother.
What reparation can you make?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reparation! Look here, at these premature
seams and wrinkles, grizzled hair and beard. Has
that unsteady hand nothing to show of an iron temper
shattered by sorrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, your selfish sorrow blinds you. These are
signs of retribution on you, not of reparation to the
party injured. Don Augustino, I joined this expedition
with the sole purpose of saving from ruin, if I
might, a lad whom I despise for his vices; and do
you think I will leave longer at your mercy the real
Hilo, whom, in place of condemning, I can only
pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That rests with me,” returned the maître-de-camp,
with a slight sneer. “But listen to me, Don
Pedro; you judge my case before it is stated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finish, sir,” answered Padilh, moodily, resuming
his seat; “and heaven grant your conscience proves
clearer than it seems to me likely to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inique, without comment, took up the word where
the interruption occurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My reasoning took this shape. My daughter is
a puny thing—there is no probability of her surviving
to even girlhood. What does it matter if the baby
is betrothed to her brother? As for De Ladron, if
he ever returns from the new world, how is he to
recognize his boy, grown out of remembrance, if the
child does not die—he seems pining away rapidly—before
that time. Hernan Ladron I never saw
again; but his infant grew strong and healthy in our
change of climate, and this vexed me hourly. I had
felt sure the weakly thing could not live, or the exchange
would not have been made; and now, he
was growing up a quiet, mild boy—pah! it made me
sick to think he believed himself my son, as did all
the world beside. The sense of this contrast pushed
from my brain all other concern. I cursed the
grasping folly which had tempted me to barter a
gallant fellow, like my own boy, for an estate and
this whey-faced child. However, he should go to
war with me, and be cured of his girlishness. But
when, at St. Quentin, he fled before the first charge
of the French, cowering at my stirrup, I was frantic
with rage and shame. I had no love for the boy;
his very existence was a daily threat of exposure,
and I beat him, as you all saw, with my sword hilt,
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
to drive him a second time into the fight. What followed,
too, you all knew. But, until this day, no
mortal has learnt the yearning pity that mastered my
passions and filled my breast with remorse. I believe
my first resolution was to confess my infamy
and restore the heir his wealth and name; but I
waited until he should recover, and when I saw he
was likely to remain an idiot, I changed my mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Augustino, you would have been less dishonored
by confessing your dishonor,” cried our
knight, here. “You proved yourself, in the sight of
Heaven, a greater coward than your reputed son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” replied the other, hotly, flushing red, “you
forget I am your equal in point of rank, if not virtue,
and wear a sword. You tax my forbearance
heavily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A horse in meadow neighs louder than a horse
under saddle,” answered Padilh. “Overlook the
reproach, Don Augustino, and pass on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I set some value on your friendship, and will not
consent to lose it for a hard word honestly spoken,”
Inique said, not very contentedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I altered my mind, but not altogether. I resolved
not a fraction of his income should be used in the
service of me or mine, and reduced the expenses of
my household accordingly. Hilo, my real son, left
to his own guidance at home, had become a ruinous
spendthrift, and openly revolted at any curtailment
of what he considered his rights. But against his
wickedness I had, as a set off, the patience and affection
of the supposititious son; the very qualities I
had before despised now touched me most—his
mildness of face and speech, and trustfulness in my
protection—for the whole past seemed wiped out of
his remembrance, and but a single word was capable
of recalling any portion of it—the word the Constable
of Castile spoke yesterday at table. Perhaps
the cries and sounds of battle might recall my shame
and his sorrow, but my care has hitherto proved
successful in keeping such from his ears.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet there seems to me in all this, Don Augustino,
no good reason for your becoming the boy’s
jailor,” said Sir Pedro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay. If it was hard to resolve on publishing
my infamy with my own mouth, was it easy to bear
the thought that some day it must be realised in the
growing likeness of my prisoner to his true father,
Ladron? I watched this fast maturing resemblance
with the anguish of one seeing his death warrant
signed, understanding to the full how the crime
which my voluntary confession might have softened
in the eyes of the world, would grow in odium as
time elapsed. I fancied it was only needful for you,
or any one familiar with the father’s face, to catch a
glimpse of the son’s to detect my secret; and I kept
the sole evidence near my person, not because it
was the safest, but the least harassing course it was
possible to pursue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The least harassing, Don Augustino,” the knight
said, “would have been to acknowledge your criminality
at first, and have made restitution openly
as you did in private. Better do so now than never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! when the son of a felon in yonder ship
must be disowned only to substitute a felon himself!
No, sir; the most I can do is what I now purpose—to
find this reckless youth and turn him from his vicious
life by every means but that you propose.
Only in the last extremity will I show him to be as
penniless in the future as now, and that the girl he
has exhausted his vileness to dishonor is his sister,
and I the wretched father of both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And only in such extremity will your words have
weight with Hilo de Ladron, as I suppose, for your
sake, he must yet be called, although I grudge him
the name. But it seems to me, Don Augustino Inique,
you prate more of dishonor than a man should
who has committed felony to his own conscience
and in God’s sight; and that the honor you esteem
so highly is nothing better than the declamation of
those who surround you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A truce to your sarcasms,” cried Inique, pale
with anger. “I am not here, Padilh, to listen to a
sermon or be ordered a penance. If you will help
me in this affair by your intervention, you will not
find me ungrateful; and I know enough of my own
nature, as you might, to feel assured that, left to my
own resources, I may do that in the heat of passion
which cannot be undone. What! am I so fallen in
your eyes that you cannot afford me the time and
occasion I need for amendment, or distrust my best
designs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, by St. Jago,” cried our generous don, “that
I will not, Inique. I have done you some wrong in
thought, perhaps, but I will make amends by assisting
you where I may with proper regard to my own
views and affections. But, you understand, I annex
a condition—the true Hilo must pass from your care
into mine as soon as we effect a landing. As his
nearest relative, I have a higher right to the charge
of his person than the—than yourself, Don Augustino.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don Pedro,” answered Inique, slowly, after a
pause, “you have justice on your side, and I will
not oppose the transfer if you insist. But I beg you
earnestly to consider that I, from hating, have come
to love the youth better—yes, better than my own
children; and until the present adjustment succeeds
or fails, you may do worse than leave him in my
keeping, as before—only that the doors of his prison,
as you seemed but now to consider it, are open to
you from this hour. I pledge you my word, at all
hazard or pain, to restore him to you at the close of
this expedition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, let it be so,” replied Don Pedro, surprised
and pleased at the other’s words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the maître-de-camp, with a breast somewhat
less burdened, betook himself to his ship again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A couple of days later the peaked and thickly-wooded
shores of Tercera were first visible, and the
armada coasting along, to the mortal terror of the
Portuguese, who were parceled out in companies
to defend the accessible points, and miserably ignorant
where the Spaniards would make their descent,
came to anchor off St. Catherine, where about fifty
French and twice as many Portuguese were drawn
up to oppose the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
“It would be a pity to cross the humor of the
French gentlemen, yonder,” Santa-Cruz said, with a
grim smile. “But their allies will only embarrass their
manœuvres, and had better be routed before hand.
Don’t you think we can frighten them, Pòlvora?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frighten them!” cried that cavalier; “I can see,
at this distance, the finery of some glittering in the
sunshine, as if the wearers were shaking all over.
Let us try if they are not too frightened to run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the signal was given, and a general discharge
of cannon followed from the fleet, doing no special
harm. I believe the widow Jean’s son was decapitated,
and that young fool, Allain, who must needs
leave his pretty sweetheart Annette in Floillé to pick
up a little glory, that his marriage might come off
with more eclat than any in his village, lost a leg or
arm; but these were trifles nobody minds in a skirmish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, it was before the balls came bumping
along the sands—indeed, while they were disporting,
like great whales, in the outer surf, and casting up
jets of water at each <span class='it'>ricochet</span>, that the brave rear-guard
took to their heels—a piece of prudence for
which I beg the indulgence of those military young
men who are suffered by their employers to sport
moustachios in their shops and counting-houses, and
whose chief motive for advocating, in strong language,
a dissolution of the Union, is supposed to lie
in the admirable opportunity to be afforded of winning
undying laurels in civil warfare; for I would
intimate, however reprehensible cowardice may be
on any occasion, and on this in particular, that watching
the lively skipping from wave to wave of such
iron globes as a 42-pounder debouches, while chatting
with the officer of artillery, who has just sighted
the piece at a hogshead anchored in the bay, is quite
a different thing from doing the same when serving
as the hogshead yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yonder go a brave enemy!” cried Padilh, with
a laugh, to his colleague in the next barge, the two
maîtres-de-camp heading the flotilla with the landing
party. “If any fall in your way hereafter, don’t
forget they’re women; spare their lives, as you
wear spurs, señor mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Inique answered, standing erect in the
stern and shading his eyes with his palm, quite another
personage in voice and carriage from the penitent
of two days back:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the line of the French has not a gap in it—yes,
one, which they have just filled with a fresh
man. There’ll be sharp work there, Padilh, although
we are strong enough to surround and capture
the whole detachment. Lay to your oars, men!
Make prisoners of as many of the gallant fellows as
you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s come over the master?” grumbled a sergeant
to a crony. “Last time he marched against
the French it was nothing but ‘keep your pikes
level, my lads; the man that fails to spit his man,
deserves to be cut over the head in return.’ And
now <a id='nowits'></a>it’s, ‘don’t hurt them, these fine fellows.’ You
see, I like a man to be one thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, they say Señor Inique has a cousin, or a
son-in-law, or something of the sort, who is no better
than he should be, and at this moment in the French
camp. Who knows if the señor hasn’t an idea of
turning coat some day himself? It looks like it, don’t
it, sergeant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; hang it, man, he wouldn’t do such a dirty
thing. Why, don’t you know, you unbelieving
Thomas, there ain’t a gentleman in all Spain with
such a name for honor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, may be; but I like to be sure of a thing of
the sort. Honesty and uprightness is my motto.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey! what’s that Mig’s saying?” said a sailor
who pulled the bow oar, with a grin, to his neighbor.
“I lived near La Mécha myself, egad! and I know
there wa’n’t a lamb sure of being raised so long as
<span class='it'>he</span> was about. May be he’s forgot my phiz, with
the tip of my nose sliced off by that turbaned chap’s
cim’tar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the gossip was kept up until a volley of twenty
or so arquebuses, as the fleet grounded in tolerable
line, turned their thoughts too busily in another channel
to leave time for such tattling; and the old campaigners
of the later Moorish wars were out and
formed in “battle” before Capt. Bourgignon poured
in his reserve fire, and fell upon the invaders with
the audacity of a hawk half as large as your hand
pouncing upon a turkey a fourth as big as your body;
only that the enemy was not in any respect like a
turkey—more like a condor, I should say, in point of
ferocity and collected action. He marched up from
the submerged beach to the sands above high-water,
with no more concern for the struggling handful in
front than you or I would for the whiff of sleet blown
in our faces on a windy day in the streets. To be
sure, the smooth tablet left by the last tide, was
written over with a heavy stylus, and dabbled with
such ink as conquerors and others who leave their
mark on the times in which they lived, employ;
moreover, there were numerous unsightly blotches
dropped about, which retained enough vitality sometimes
to scream in a manner calculated to shock our
fire-eating civilians into a wholesome distaste to
civil collision and slaying. Of course, such things are
necessities, like lightning and volcanic eruptions, despite
the efforts of Mr. Burritt to show the contrary.
The exception appears strongest when one of us
loses a brother or a husband, with a bullet in the
heart or head, as Amelia did George at Brussels, or
more than one acquaintance of mine, now wearing
premature widow’s-weeds, in the late Mexican war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole, there is something vastly fascinating
in military display and glory; and I confess,
when I call to mind the bray of trumpets, glint of
steel harness, and gallant show of surcoats, paraded
that July morning along the St. Catherine beach, I
am tempted to drag my obliging reader into the thick
of the fight, and recapitulate, with cannibal appetite,
the shouts, groans, and extorted cries of agony, by
which you could have told with shut eyes how the
work advanced, and where this or that poor devil
was left sprawling on the driftweed, with a saucer
full of blood in a sea-shell, perhaps, just under his
left side; to say nothing of those who enacted the
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
parts, as near as their heavy armor and different locomotive
organization allowed, of fowls recently
beheaded—a sight full of interest to even those darlings
of mamma who are brought up to feed sparrows
with crumbs, but slay mice and centipedes
without restriction. All I intend relating of this
skirmish is, that Capt. Bourgignon was killed, as
were most of his officers, and as to the fifteen men
remaining out of the fifty, not one was without a
wound. They could not have acquitted themselves
better had De Chaste himself been present, which
he was not, but on the opposite side of a high promontory
lying next La Praya, making what haste he
might to come up with the combatants, whose whereabouts
he knew by the cannonading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three days before this the viceroy had sent word
to the commander that the Spanish fleet could plainly
be seen from the Peak; and riding along the coast,
De Chaste heard the sentinels posted on the mountains
ringing bells and firing their arquebuses, in
token of the approach of the enemy, who were not
long in arriving within gun-shot of the shore, and
keeping the islanders in constant alarm, as before
hinted, by cannon shots and the hovering of a cluster
of galleys about every available landing. The
French general had his hands full in following these
last, encouraging his little garrisons, and endeavoring
to find bread for his troops, whose dinners the
Count de Torrevedros never troubled himself about.
Indeed, that viceregal nobleman had enough to do
to consider how best to ingratiate himself with the
Marquis of Santa-Cruz, and for the present keep out
of harm’s way. It was not only the count, however,
who cared little for the landing of the Spaniards
and ruin of the French, provided their persons
and property remained secure—a tolerably universal
wish being that their allies had gone to the
bottom before reaching Tercera and dragging them
into a siege, when all they wanted was safety and
submission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Senhor Commandante,” said the Portuguese
captain at La Praya, while the pair rode out, as
usual, with a company or two at their heels, “you
can now see for yourself, yonder, how little the number
of the enemy has been magnified.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better,” answered the commander,
like the Wolf in Little Red Ridinghood; “we will
have more to make prisoners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O—h!” cried the Portuguese, the idea being new
to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound the man’s bragging,” he muttered to
himself; “he talks as if they were children or savages
he has to do with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon De Chaste added, with something like
a smile on his hard face:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see at least, senhor captain, they are not
afraid of us, if we are of them, for they pull within
reach of our batteries; and here comes a ball to measure
the distance between us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“St. Hubert! Are we to stand here to be shot
without chance of drawing sword?” cried Captain
Gaza, brushing the sand thrown over him from his
holyday doublet. “It is madness, sir commander,
madness; and I cannot expose my brave men to
such needless danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you like best; you will find a half mile up the
beach out of cannon range,” indifferently rejoined
the French knight, and spurred closer to the water’s
edge, followed by his countrymen, many of whom,
in passing, saluted the Portuguese ironically, while
others, out of earshot of the conversation, wondered
at the blanched visage of the captain, and his taking
himself and company to the skirt of the wood a mile
or more back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Duvict,” said De Chaste, presently, to that cavalier,
whom he had called to his side, “you will ride
over to-night to Angra, and tell the viceroy we all
count it strange, that, with the enemy threatening
the coast, he is no where to be seen; perhaps, if he
is bent on shutting up himself, he will take this captain
off our hands; the fewer such cowards in our
ranks, the better chance will we have of successful
defense. At all events, I insist on the withdrawal
of this Gaza, even if his troop goes with him. Moreover,
I demand in the queen’s name, an immediate
supply of rations for our men here and elsewhere.
Lose no time on your journey.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so well pleased with the errand, that I will
set out this instant, monseigneur, if you consent.
Why wait until our return to Porta Praya?” cried
Duvict, cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, then,” answered the commander, nodding
approval; “and if he is not to be met with at Angra,
search the country till you find him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The viceroy was not at Angra, that city being too
exposed to bombardment to suit his present fancy;
but the Frenchman found him at his country-house
among the hills, keeping a sharp look-out over the
roads leading coastward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell the honorable commander,” replied Torrevedros,
dissembling his annoyance at the ambassador’s
blunt message, “I will surely join him as
soon as I make certain levies, calculated to do him
more service than five troop of horse. But I take
it ill, he shows so little faith in my concern for his
safety at the present extremity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for his safety,” answered Duvict, who was
not much of a courtier, “our commandant can very
well take care of that and ours. It is for your own
honor, and the putting your people in good heart,
which, by the three kings, they want mightily!
Monseigneur troubles himself with your absence,
M. le Viceroi. Meanwhile, it would not be amiss
to give our soldiers something withal to fill their
mouths, especially as we may be obliged to do most
of the fighting before the new levies arrive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will soon have abundance for all,” the
count made answer, smoothly. “Hasten down,
and inform your commandant I will delay here not
an hour beyond what is necessary, on the honor of
a knight. You said truly, sir, we must have no
cowards in our ranks, either French or Portuguese.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. le Viceroi, your acquaintance with your own
countrymen is indisputable,” Duvict here said superciliously,
“but we French are taught in a different
school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
“Let it pass,” rejoined Torrevedros, biting his
lip. “If I designed to wound your self-love, it
would not be in my own house. I will show my
willingness at least to oblige M. de Chaste, by
cashiering my captain at Porta Praya in favor of
one more reliable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was this new captain, John de Castros, who
carried De Chaste a letter from the viceroy a day
later, which that loyal nobleman had received from
Santa Cruz by a Portuguese, caught off the coast, and
forced to swim ashore with the dispatch tied about
his neck—the French not suffering any boat to approach
within hail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commandant tore the paper to fragments as
soon as he saw the contents. “This Count of Torrevedros,”
he said, with a short laugh, to his maître-de-camp,
who was present, “is either a fool, or
doubts our honor. The Marquis of Santa Cruz
offers him here his life, and abundant rewards, besides
the freedom of his wife and children, now in
Madrid, provided he surrenders the island, which he
might well enough do as far as himself is concerned,
but he wishes to be rid of us at the same time, and
therefore risks being reckoned a traitor in hope of
inducing us to accept the marquis’s conditions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A traitor he is!” cried the lieutenant, indignantly.
“And since he proves himself so in so
many ways, why not return to France as we are,
without further intermeddling between him and his
lackland master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget,” returned De Chaste, “all who have
entered on this enterprise, are bound in honor to see
it through with what success their energy may obtain.
Still you, and other cavaliers who have joined
of your free will, and not by the queen’s direct command,
may do as you see proper, and leave us who
remain to share the greater glory which must attend
a defense against greater odds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir commandant,” the lieutenant responded, simply
hearing him through with some little mortification
in his frank face, “you pain me by such permission,
for neither I, nor any other French gentleman
here, would leave you an instant without being
compelled by your commands; and that I am sure
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it so well,” cried the commandant at
this, “that I am not sure I spoke the truth in even
hinting my distrust just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And truly the lieutenant was as good as his word;
for when the French crossed the neck of the promontory
I have mentioned, and coming too late to
reinforce Bourgignon, fell upon a strong party of
the Spaniards, detailed to take possession of a spring
near by, with a determination which brought about
a general and very bloody battle; there was not one
in the tremendous uproar of voices and of arms,
smoke of arquebuses, blood spattered and welling,
screams, shrieks, groans, and huzzas!—huzzas!
ensuing—who did such execution with the sword,
as that same lieutenant; it was he that killed the
father of poor little Margueretta, who, for want of
bread, the next year became what even famine must
not excuse. And, perhaps, as he did his share of
irreparable mischief with an easy conscience, and
certainly to the best of his ability, when his corpse
lay stark as the mail encasing it, that same afternoon,
by the eminence to the left, where Hilo was
seen aiming an arquebuse at one time of the fight,
his spirit may have been regaling in Paradise with
other performers of that much abused sentiment, duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a hot, sultry afternoon at —— ——, a
fashionable summer resort at the sea side. The
three great events of the day were accomplished—namely,
the bath, dinner, and the arrival of the boat
bringing the mail; the visiters, therefore, had nothing
to do but to get rid of the afternoon in as noisy a
manner as possible, keeping themselves as warm
and uncomfortable as they could, in order to prove
that they were enjoying themselves after the most
approved fashion. Ladies could be seen in every
direction, passing from one hotel to another, flitting
in and out of cottages, dressed in the most incongruous
style—in silks, mulls, and gauzes, fitted for a
full-dress dinner or evening party; and surmounting
this dressy costume was—the only really sensible
article to be seen in this dominion of Folly—the
prim, plain country sun-bonnet. Fashion had established
that hats at the sea-side were vulgar, and accordingly,
every belle mounted one of these useful,
but exceedingly ugly head-dresses. Carriages and
wagons of every description darted to and fro, from
the funny little Jersey sand wagon, with horses of a
Jersey match, gray and brown, or black and white,
up to the well matched, well ordered establishment
of the <span class='it'>nouveau riche</span>, who was willing to sacrifice
his delicate town-bred horses, in order to exhibit his
magnificence to the <span class='it'>plebs</span>. A fine establishment drew
up in front of the entrance of one of the principal
hotels, and the owner of it, Mr. Martin, a prosperous
merchant, with his fussy, dressy, good-natured, fat
little wife, entered it. As Mr. Martin handed his
wife in, he asked,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Edda?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let her alone, my dear,” replied his wife,
“she will get over her moping after awhile. She’s
fretted herself into a sick headache, and is lying
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confound the fellow,” muttered Mr. Martin, “I
wish she had never seen him. If I had my way she
should be divorced from him. What right has a
man to a wife when he cannot support her? Now,
as long as he lives, I suppose, our poor little darling
will be down-hearted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said the wife, settling herself back comfortably
in the luxurious carriage, after having carefully
disposed the folds of her rich, silk gown and
heavily embroidered mantle in a manner to crush
them the least, “wait until he gets fairly settled out
at the West, and the winter parties, and concerts,
and operas commence, then Edda will cheer up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, with all my heart,” ejaculated Mr.
Martin, “and if money, amusements, and fine clothes
can make her what she was two years ago, I shall
be glad enough, for I hate a sad, gloomy face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they were thus talking, their niece, the
subject of their conversation, was lying in her bed-room,
burying her throbbing, aching head in the
pillows of the couch, wishing that an endless sleep
would come to her, and deaden the painful sense of
grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Edda Murray! Two short years before, a
happier, more free-from-care girl could not have been
found. Then, she had never known a trouble. Her
aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Martin, who were
childless, and possessed ample means, had taken her
at the time of her parents’ death, which had occurred
during her infancy, and from that moment up to the
present, she had been their spoiled pet and darling.
They were good-natured, indolent people, caring for
but little else than the amusements of the out-of-doors
world. As Edda grew old enough to enter society,
they took great pleasure in dressing her extravagantly,
and accompanying her to every gay place of
resort of the fashionable world. According to Mrs.
Martin’s ideas, every girl should be married early;
and when Edda was addressed by Mr. Murray, near
the close of her first winter, and seemed pleased
with his attentions, her aunt’s rapture knew no
bounds. Mr. Martin was pleased also, for Murray,
though a young man, was a rising merchant, and
was steady and industrious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How Ralph Murray ever happened to fancy Edda
Martin, was a mystery to all those of his and her
friends, who had observed but little of this marriage
business of life. As a general rule, both men and
women, especially when young, select the very
companions that are the most unlike their ideals, and
what is still stranger, the most unsuitable for them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ralph Murray was a reserved, dignified young
man, rather stern for his years, with the most rigid
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
ideas of justice and propriety, even in trifles; exact
in every thing, and making but little allowance for
others less exact than himself. He did not require
more than he was willing to give in return, but he
had no consideration, no patience, and when disappointed,
was apt to become cold, moody, and uncompromising.
In woman he had always required,
“that monster perfection.” His mother had been a
model of feminine propriety. He had no sisters, but
a whole troop of cousins, who happened to be laughing,
hoydenish, good-natured creatures; but they
were his utter abomination, he never countenanced
them, pronouncing them silly, frivolous, and senseless;
but how they laughed and <a id='tea'></a>teased him, when
his engagement with Edda Martin was announced—verily
they had their revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edda was, indeed, a spoiled pet, full of caprice
and whim, beautiful and graceful as a fairy, and as
untamed and uncontrollable as an unwedded Undine.
But, poor child, marriage brought no happy spirit to
dwell in her household. How could it? For they
had married under the influence of the maddest,
wildest infatuation. Their love was beautiful while
it lasted; but soon the husband grew exacting, the
angel became a mere woman, and the darling, who
had never obeyed any will but her own, discovered
she had a lord and master, whose will was stronger
and more unbending than even her own had ever been.
Then Edda was extravagant and thriftless, and
thoughtless, a real child-wife, like poor Dora, that
English Undine creation of Dickens’s fancy, but with
more spirit and temper than “Little Blossom.”
Edda’s character had in it qualities which would have
made her a fine woman, properly and gradually developed;
but her husband placed her on the scale of
his own model of perfection, and endeavored to drag
her up to this idea of wifehood, without waiting for
Nature to assist him. It was the old, sad story told
over again—incompatibility of tempers, unreasonableness
on his part, petulance, waywardness and temper
on hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>God sent them a little babe, but the child brought
no tenderness to the heart of either parent for each
other. Then trouble came upon Ralph Murray in
his business—unfortunate speculations, bad failures
in others he had trusted; but instead of going to his
wife, and talking affectionately, but candidly, remembering
all the while what a spoiled darling she
had been, he considered himself aggrieved by her
lavish expenditure, and told her haughtily that she
was now the wife of a young merchant, and not the
niece of a rich man, and ought to have sense enough
to observe economy. Poor Edda was offended,
bitter words passed between them, and they parted
in anger. Her aunt found her in tears—happening
to come in just as the irritated husband had left her.
Edda turned to her thoughtless, childish aunt, for
comfort, telling her the whole story of her wrongs;
and Mrs. Martin pronounced Mr. Murray a brute, to
treat her poor child so unkindly. Mr. Martin thought
always as his wife did, and in the first flush of
temper, they carried the weeping, angry wife, with
her young babe, away from her husband’s roof; the
exasperated uncle leaving for Mr. Murray an angrily
worded note, in which he said that Edda had never
ceased to be his niece, even if she had been so unfortunate
as to become the wife of a parsimonious
merchant, and an unkind husband. The following
day Ralph Murray was a bankrupt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of other heavy failures of houses indebted
to him, brought his affairs to a crisis, and all
his troubles seemed piled mountain high upon him
at once. Poor Edda would have gone instantly to
her husband when she heard of his trouble—for
she had immediately repented of her hasty step—but
she did not dare; she remembered his sternness, and
dreaded a repulse which she felt she deserved.
Then a new cause of anxiety displayed itself, her boy
sickened, and, after a few hours’ illness, he died in
her arms. Her husband was sent for, but he did
not notice her; he stood beside the coffin of his child,
pale, tearless, and with a countenance as unchanging
as a statue of marble; he never looked at his sobbing
wife, who, softened by her grief, would have
willingly thrown herself into his arms, and asked
pardon for the past, and forbearance for the future;
but he coldly turned from her after the funeral, without
speaking a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two months passed by, and still Ralph Murray
treated his wife with the same silent indifference.
He never sought an interview nor an explanation;
it seemed as if the death of their child, instead of
softening him, had, to his mind, broken off all connection
between them. Edda grieved incessantly,
until at last her health became seriously affected.
When the traveling season came, the physicians who
had been called in to heal the poor breaking heart, recommended
an instant departure for the sea-side.
Fine apartments were procured, every elegance,
every luxury surrounded her; but she looked more
wretched, more unhappy every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew that their beautiful house belonged to
another—every thing had been sold; that she no
longer had a home with her husband; and the consciousness
that she was a childless, lonely wife, became
daily more insupportable. Poor girl! life
seemed very dark and hopeless to her. Her trouble
had lifted her spirit on almost a life time; all the
childish, capricious waywardness of girlhood had
disappeared; sorrow had done the work of years;
and she was now a woman—but a suffering, loving
woman, ready to make any sacrifice, perform any
duty, to atone for the past. Her uncle and aunt caressed
her, and sympathized with her, while they
incessantly spoke of her husband with words of reproach
and blame; and when she would check
them, saying the greater part of the blame rested on
herself, they would think her still more lovely and
amiable, and lift their hands in surprise. How reproaching
to her conscience was their sympathy!
and she grew more and more despairing and hopeless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At midnight she would pace her room, wringing
her little hands with remorse for the past. Her
husband’s stern face would rise before her, blended
with the beautiful, loving expression his countenance
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
had worn during the delicious season of courtship.
Then she would recall every noble, honorable trait
in his character, and remember her own willful conduct.
All, all was over, and henceforth she would
have to live without him. This seemed impossible;
and the poor girl would call on Heaven, agonizingly,
to take her away from life or give her back her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All her friends upheld her and blamed Mr. Murray.
They called him stern, cold and heartless.
The fashionable world thought her a lucky woman
in possessing a rich old uncle to take care of her.
Her quarrel with her cross husband had taken place
in the very nick of time, they said; now she need
not suffer from his mischances; when she would
so willingly have borne the very heaviest burden
poverty could impose. But what could she do but
suffer idly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Day after day passed by, still no message came
from her husband. Her uncle had told her that the
principal creditors had willingly and generously arranged
matters; for, as every one said, the failure
had resulted from misfortune, not from mismanagement,
and that he had heard that a friend had offered
Mr. Murray a situation in a commercial house out
in the very farthest west, with a chance of becoming
a partner in time. Then the next news that reached
her was, that he was actually leaving for his new
home. And would Ralph leave her without a word—a
line? she asked herself over and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last a letter came—a cold, stern, haughty letter,
bidding her farewell, as if for ever. There were
one or two tender passages in it; but the tone of the
whole letter was so cold and unforgiving, that it
crushed her to the earth. She had received it the
day before our little sketch opens; and when her
aunt urged her to drive out and shake off her trouble,
she only buried her little head still deeper in the pillows
and prayed still more agonizingly for death.
The afternoon passed slowly enough to the poor
sufferer. Then came the evening—the noisy, gay
evening. As there was a ball in the saloon of the
hotel, her thoughtless, butterfly aunt and uncle
joined the merry crowd of triflers, after an earnest
but unsuccessful persuasion of Edda to follow their
example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The merry music of the band sounded loudly in
Edda’s lonely bed-room; but the lively dancing melodies
seemed to her ears like the voices of taunting
demons. She restlessly rose from her bed and
walked into her little parlor, which opened on a balcony
that swept around the house. She stepped out
on this balcony, and listened to the pealing thunder
of the ocean, which rolled unceasingly before her.
Her agony increased, and a demon seemed to whisper
in her ears:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is life but a torment? Death is an endless,
dreamless sleep. Why suffer when you can so
easily find relief?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shudderingly she put her little hands to her ears,
and, closing her eyes, hastened into the room, fearing
that in another instant she might be induced, by
despair, to plunge headlong over the railings on the
cliff beneath. For a while she laid on the lounge,
as if stunned; but at last tears came to her relief, and
she felt calmer. To avoid danger she closed the
Venetian shutters of the door and window, but drew
up under them the lounge, and threw herself on it,
that the damp night air might cool her fevered, burning
head. She had not been long there when she
heard the sound of voices and laughter, but she was
too weak to arise, and remained quiet—remembering
that she could not be seen from the outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a little group of young girls, who were promenading
after the dance, and who had concluded that
the upper balcony commanded a finer view of the
ocean. As chance would have it they selected that
part of the balcony just under Edda’s window for their
gossiping lounge. One, more sentimental than the
others, pointed out the effect of the moon-beams
which made the edges of the rolling, dashing waves
shine like molten silver. But the beauty of the
scene was quickly lost, even on this moon-struck
damsel, for she, as well as the rest, were soon deeply
interested in discussing a wedding that had lately
taken place in the <span class='it'>beau-monde</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, dear, there’s Mrs. Jones,” exclaimed one,
“she just came from town yesterday, and can tell
us all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady mentioned joined the group, and threw
them into a state of perfect felicity by telling them
she had actually been present at the wedding. Immediately
she was called upon by a dozen eager
voices to tell them “all about it.” Poor Edda, she
was doomed to listen to the whole senseless detail,
commencing at the bride’s India mull robe, and its
heavy, elaborate embroidery, her “exquisite and
graceful head-dress,” with the costly Honiton veil,
the “rich splendid gifts” of the relatives, and ending
with the list of bridemaids and their costume. How
the whole description brought her own gorgeous
wedding back to her thoughts! and she felt heart-sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor things!” she murmured to herself with a
sigh, “I hope they will be happier than Ralph and I
have been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conversation grew more bustling and detached;
the lady who was the reporter-general was
giving, for the fifth time, to some new comer, a description
of the bride’s costume, which she did with
a volubility so eloquent and untiring as to have reflected
credit on a French <span class='it'>modiste</span>—expatiating
largely on the beauty and costliness of the materials
of which it was composed, and united to her minute
details of the tucks, headed by rich rows of lace and
embroidery, could be heard exclamations of the
others, who had already listened to the description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said one, in a tone of voice that told what
delicious satisfaction costly articles of dress gave
her, “it is too lovely to be married in an India robe,
with heavy embroidery and rich Valenciennes <span class='it'>berthé</span>
and trimming. If ever I’m married, I intend to make
ma order one of Levy’s for me; it shall be imported
especially for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Mrs. Jones, stopping in the midst
of her harangue, <span class='it'>à la</span> parenthesis, “Mr. Grugan received
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span>
the order for Blanche’s wedding robe last
year, the very day Mr. Holmes offered. No one
knew it but her family, except me—I knew it, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe she knew a word about it. Mrs.
Jones is always pretending she’s so intimate with
every body,” said a young lady, <span class='it'>sotto voce</span>; but Mrs.
Jones was too deeply engaged in the tucks, and lace
trimming, and Honiton veil, to hear the doubt and
charge. The conversation increased in animation,
and Mrs. Jones’s clear, high voice was almost
drowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” exclaimed one, “<a id='its'></a>it’s splendid to be married
in such style.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” rejoined another, “and how delightful to
go right off on a journey, and to Europe, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, girls,” exclaimed one, “only think—<a id='blan'></a>Blanche
Forrester went to school with me, and, here, she’s
married!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said another, “her first bridemaid, Helen
Howell, and Aubrey Hilton, are engaged, and
Helen was in the same class with me. We all came
out last fall together—you’re no worse off than I
am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some gentlemen joining the group, the conversation
became too detached and confused to be heard,
and there were so many little bursts of laughter as to
make the whole affair quite a medley. Presently the
scraping of the violins, preceded by a loud crash of
the whole united band, announced that a waltz was
about to be danced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” they exclaimed, simultaneously, “that delicious
<a id='scho'></a><span class='it'>Schottische</span>,” and soon the balcony was empty—or
at least so thought Edda; but she was mistaken,
for she heard other voices. A lady and gentleman
had seated themselves under her window, and were
enjoying the sight of the waves and moonlight. She
knew their voices well. One was a Mrs. Howard,
a gentle, lady-like woman, for whom her husband
entertained the highest respect. Edda knew but
little of her; she had met her in society after her
marriage, but had always drawn back a little in awe
when she had met with her, because she constantly
heard Ralph holding her up as such a model of wifely
dignity and propriety. The other was a Mr. Morrison—a
cynical, fault-finding old bachelor—or, at
least, Edda had always regarded him as such. No
wonder the poor girl shrank still closer to the lounge—she
seemed doomed to be persecuted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Howard and Mr. Morrison had heard part of
the conversation about the wedding, and the first that
reached Edda’s ears were Mr. Morrison’s severe,
caustic remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly, senseless fools!” he exclaimed. “They
talk as if life had but two points to attain; to get
married in an India robe, in such a style as to produce
a fine theatrical effect, and to go to Europe.
What right have such idiots to get married at all?
What do they know of the realities of married life—the
holy, sacred obligations of marriage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very little, it is true,” answered his companion;
“and this ignorance is wisely ordered! for I am
afraid, Mr. Morrison, if these young, thoughtless
creatures knew the one half of life’s stern realities,
whether married or unmarried, they would sooner
lie down and die than encounter them. Youth is as
hopeless in trouble as it is thoughtless in prosperity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true, madam, very true,” said the old gentleman;
“but it seems to me that these frivolous
creatures might be taught a little—enough to give
them some ballast. What sort of wives will they
make? Why, I declare it makes me shudder when
I see these silly, thoughtless wretches entering into
marriage as they would into a dance—not displaying
half the anxiety that a man would on entering into
a commercial engagement that can be dissolved at
will after a certain season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the lady, with a sweet, low laugh,
“from what we see on all sides, my dear sir, a great
many of those who marry at the present day seem to
regard marriage only as a mere partnership, to be
dissolved at will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would pretty soon put an end to that divorce
business, madam,” said Mr. Morrison, “if I had the
power. Every couple that could not live happily
together, and wished to be separated, should have
their request granted, but on one condition—that
both, particularly the woman, should go into some
religious asylum, and spend the rest of their days in
entire seclusion, employed constantly in the performance
of strict religious duties and works of charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed the lady, laughing outright, “I
am very sure any husband and wife would prefer the
most inharmonious intercourse to such an alternative.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well,” said Mr. Morrison, “they could
have their choice, and it would teach others to be
more careful how they ‘married in haste to repent
at leisure.’ This is becoming a curse to society; on
all sides we see husbands and wives disagreeing.
Now-a-days a wife must spend as much money as
she pleases, lead a dissipated life—for going to parties
and balls, and every other gay place, constantly
is dissipation—entertain admirers, and her husband
must not complain. He, poor devil—beg pardon,
madam—must not express a wish for a quiet home
and a companion, after the toil of the day and the
wear and tear of exciting, perilous business. Oh,
no! If he does madam will leave him in a huff, and
he may whistle for a wife, and life is a wreck to him
ever afterward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do these unhappy marriages always result from
the thoughtlessness and selfishness of the wives, my
dear sir?” asked Mrs. Howard. “I think there are
as many wives with domestic tastes, who have the
same complaint to make against their husbands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes,” answered Mr. Morrison, a little hesitatingly;
“I suppose there is blame to be found on
both sides; but generally speaking, with the married
people of what is called ‘society,’ especially the
young, the fault lies with the wife. Yesterday I
bade good-bye to as fine a fellow as God ever created,
whose whole happiness for life has been
wrecked by one of these silly, heartless fools. You
know him, my dear madam, and are, I believe, one
of his few friends; for the whole world unite in condemning
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
him and upholding his doll-baby wife in her
sinful disobedience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are speaking of Ralph Murray, I am sure,”
said Mrs. Howard, in a sad tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Edda writhed, but she had not power to
move; she felt spell-bound, and every word of the
conversation fell on her ear with painful clearness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I mean Murray,” replied Mr. Morrison.
“God help him, poor fellow! His haggard face haunts
me like a ghost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said Mrs. Howard, “much as I love Ralph,
much as I respect his high, honorable character, I
cannot hold him blameless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” exclaimed Mr. Morrison, in a tone of
surprise, “you cannot hold him blameless? Why,
what can you see wrong in any thing he has done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He should not have married as he did,” replied
Mrs. Howard; “or if determined to gratify his fancy
at the expense of his judgment, by yielding to an infatuation,
he should have had more patience with his
wife. If he felt willing to trust his happiness in the
hands of a petted, spoiled child, he should have remembered
what she was, in the hour of trial, and
not exacted of her the ability and judgment which
are possessed only by a sensible, well-trained woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you are right,” answered Mr. Morrison,
after a short pause; “he was wrong in the first place—he
never should have married such an idiot. But,
my God, madam,” he exclaimed, impatiently, “any
woman who was lucky enough to get such a noble
husband as Ralph Murray, should have been so
proud of him as to have been willing to have made
every sacrifice of whim and caprice for his comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true man’s reasoning,” said Mrs. Howard,
good-naturedly. “But, Mr. Morrison, I think I
am not mistaken when I say that if Ralph had managed
his pretty, petted, capricious fairy of a wife
patiently and properly, their happiness would not
have been wrecked as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Their</span> happiness!” repeated Mr. Morrison, sneeringly.
“Little she cares, while she has aunt to caress
her and uncle’s money to spend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed you do her great injustice,” said Mrs.
Howard. “To be sure, I do not know Mrs. Murray
intimately, but I am certain if you were to see her
pale, wretched face and frail figure, as I do daily
in the corridor, when they bring her in, half fainting,
from the bath, you would think as I do—that, let her
husband’s sufferings be ever so great, the wife suffers
quite as much. Oh, my dear Mr. Morrison, how
I wish I were Edda Murray’s friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you do, my dear madam? Add another
to her host of sympathizers?” said the old gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Mrs. Howard, mildly; “I would
tell her to send for Ralph, to ask pardon for the past
and patience for the future, and beg him to take me
once more to his heart, and help me to be a good,
faithful wife. This she must do, or never know
peace in this life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, ha,” laughed Mr. Morrison; “why, my
dear Mrs. Howard, if she had sense and feeling
enough to act thus, she would never have behaved
as she has done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edda Murray has acted willfully and selfishly, I
admit,” said Mrs. Howard; “but we do not know
what provocations she may have had. Ralph is a
fine, noble fellow, but arbitrary and impatient—the
very kind of man that I should fancy it would not be
easy to make happy in domestic life, even if a judicious
woman were to undertake the task. Think,
then, how many excuses should be made for his impulsive,
wayward little wife, who never in her life
was subjected to control. I am certain this trouble
has done her good, however, for a woman’s character
is seldom properly developed in prosperity; like
precious metals, it must pass through the fiery furnace
of affliction—it must be purified in the crucible
of sorrow, until it loses all recollection of self. There
is a beautiful simile in the Bible, which compares
the purification of the soul to the smelting of silver.
Silver must be purged from all dross, until it is so
clear and mirror-like that it will reflect the countenance
of the refiner; thus the soul must be so pure,
in so high a state of godliness, as to reflect only the
will of the Creator. I cannot recall the passage exactly,
but I often apply it to my own sex, whose characters,
to be properly developed, must be purged
from all selfish dross, in order to make them think
only of the happiness of others—forgetful always of
self; then, like silver seven times refined and purified,
their spirits reflect only the countenance of the
purifier, which is the will or command of God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then Mr. Howard and some others joined
them, and after a little playful bantering about the
flirtation of two such steady old persons, a remark
or two on the fine night and the beauty of the
ocean scene, the party moved off and Edda at last
was alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, when Mr. and Mrs. Martin stopped at
Edda’s room door, on their way to bed, they found
her sitting at her desk writing. She kissed them,
bade them good night, and thanked them for their
affectionate inquiries, in a more cheerful manner
than she had shown for months, which gladdened
their silly, warm old hearts, and they went off comforting
themselves with the hope that all now would
be well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my dear,” said Mr. Martin, as he composed
himself to sleep, “you were right—Edda is getting
over it. She looked and talked more brightly than
she has since poor little Martin’s death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Edda really felt so, but for a reason her uncle
little suspected. Mrs. Howard’s words had given
form and impulse to her thoughts; she no longer
wasted time in mere actionless grief; she saw her
duty before her, and, hard as it was to perform, she
nobly resolved to do it. A day or so afterward, as
Ralph Murray was leaving town for his new western
home—sad, lonely, and for the first time feeling that
maybe in the past he had not been entirely free from
blame, he received a letter, directed in the delicate,
lady-like, hand-writing of his wife. With trembling
hands he opened it, and thick, short sobs swelled up
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
in his throat and hot tears sprang to his eyes, as he
read her childish, frank, penitent appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am your wife, Ralph,” she wrote; “you must
not leave me—you must take me with you. God
joined us, and trouble—death has bound us still
closer. Pardon my past waywardness, and take
your penitent, suffering Edda back to your heart.
Think what a reckless, thoughtless, uncontrolled
child I was when you married me, and have
patience with me. I cannot live without you,
Ralph. I shall die broken-hearted if you treat
my selfish, wayward conduct as it merits. God
forgives the penitent—will you be more just than He
is, my beloved? Come to me, and let me hear from
your lips once more, ‘dear Edda.’ Do not tell me
you are poor; I can live on any thing, submit to any
privation, if blessed with your presence, your forgiveness,
your love. You shall not find me in the future
a thoughtless, extravagant child, but, with God’s
help, a faithful good wife. Oh, Ralph, receive me
once more, I pray you, and let me be again your own
darling little wife Edda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fashionable world at —— was thrown into
a state of astonishment a few weeks afterward, by
hearing that Mrs. Murray had actually gone out
west with her cruel, good-for-nothing husband, and
a thousand different stories were told about the
matter, each one as far from the truth as the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Mr. and Mrs. Martin made loud opposition
when Edda told them her resolve, but she looked so
bright and happy, and throwing her arms around her
aunt and uncle, made them read the lover-like letter
of her husband, in which he not only freely forgave
the past, but took on himself all the blame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s right, my dear,” said Mr. Martin, to his
wife; “but we must not let them go—we must make
them as comfortable as we can with us. Thank
Providence, I have enough for us all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ralph Murray steadily refused all offers of
assistance from Mr. Martin. He knew it would be
better for them, for a little while at least, to be away
from all Edda’s old connections. Several years they
spent “out west,” and not until they had nearly
reached mid-life, did they return to their old home in
——; then, at the urgent request of Mr. and Mrs. Martin,
who had grown old, infirm, and tired of society,
and really needed Edda, they moved back. Edda was
a lovely looking matron at the time of her return—she
seemed so happy and contented. I well remember
the pleasant effect it produced upon me when I saw
her surrounded by her troop of noble boys, and leaning
on her husband, who still retained his dignity,
but blent with it was an air of loving softness that
he had gained by intercourse with his gentle, “darling
little wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her married life, even after their reconciliation,
however, was not exempt from trials. There were
times when her husband’s old moods of exaction and
impatience would come over him, and her own willful,
rebellious spirit would stand in the way, and
torment her with demands, such as “what right has
he more than I?” and the like—as if the gratification
of rights, merely for justice sake, made up the
happiness of home life, a happiness that is only
gained, only insured, by love’s sweet yieldings.
They both tried to struggle against these dark influences;
but at such times life would be very dreary
to her, and it needed all the strict discipline of her
faith—all her hope and trust in Heaven, to make her
victorious over self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their children, however, proved angel-blessings
to them. They softened and humanized Ralph, and
soothed and occupied Edda. Dear Edda! her spring
season had been a wild, frolicksome one, bringing
a stormy, cloudy summer; but her autumn yielded
a rich harvest of happiness, and her little, throbbing
heart thanked God hourly for his kindness and
love to her in sustaining her through all her dark
hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven great boys, and not one daughter!”
exclaimed our old friend, Mrs. Howard, to Edda,
after her return to her old home—“what a
pity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” replied Edda, quickly; “I am always
so thankful my children are all boys. I would not
have the charge of a daughter’s happiness on me for
a world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why!” asked Mrs. Howard with surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” replied Edda, in a low tone, looking
significantly at the good old lady, “a woman’s character
seldom develops in prosperity—it requires,
like precious metals, the fiery furnace of affliction—the
crucible of sorrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Howard’s surprise was increased, for Edda’s
blushing face and lips, trembling with emotion, told
that she had a deeper meaning than the mere expression
of an opinion; but Edda soon removed her
wonder. She told her the whole history of the past—her
struggle on that eventful night at the sea-side
watering place years before, when the fearful temptation
to self-destruction had assailed her; she
caused the kind old lady’s eyes to grow dim with
tears, when she described the beneficial effect produced
by the overheard conversation between her
and Mr. Morrison; and added, with tears and smiles
of joy—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear Mrs. Howard, your blessed words
taught me my duty. If I have any happiness in
life, I owe it, through God, to you. But, happy
wife and blessed mother, as I am, I thank God I
have no daughter’s future resting on my heart. A
woman’s lot in life is a dangerous one, either in
prosperity or adversity, and to tread her life-path
well she seems to require almost a special helping
from God; to but few is this granted, and many
there are who wrestle darkly and blindly with sorrow
through life’s perilous journey unaided.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” replied Mrs. Howard, “does it not strike
you that you are taking but a one-sided, narrow
view of life, my dear? When you speak so sadly
of woman’s lot, it seems as if you thought this
life was all we had to expect, when I am sure you
do not think so. The perils of life belong to both
man and woman. But what matters all that we suffer
in this state of existence, when compared with
the glory of the sun-light of eternity—that sun which
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
has no setting, and of the rising of which this dark,
perilous life-hour is but the precursor—the hour before
the dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right, my dear madam,” said Edda,
with a sweet look of meek thoughtfulness, “and I,
of all other women, should not speak so hopelessly,
for, after all my dark hours, light came at last;
and so beautiful is life to me now, that I sometimes
fancy to me is given a glimpse of Heaven’s dawning.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This venerable sailor is in the 92d year of his age;
nearly sixty of which he has spent on the ocean, and thirty-five
under the stars and stripes of his adopted country.
Although almost helpless from age, his mind is clear and
his memory retentive. He remembers distinctly many
interesting incidents during his cruisings with that eccentric
but intrepid officer, John Paul Jones, and narrates
many of the daring exploits in which he was a participator
under the direction of this extraordinary man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thomas Johnson is a Norwegian by birth, the son of a
pilot at Mandal, a seaport on the coast of Norway, where
he was born in the year 1758. Having been engaged in
that occupation for nearly twenty years, he was consequently
accustomed to a seafaring life; and in the absence
of his father towed the first American vessel into
the harbor of Mandal. This vessel was the <span class='it'>Ranger</span>, from
Boston, carrying eighteen guns, under the command of
Captain Jones. The sight of a ship from a country which
was at this time struggling for independence, and of which
they knew so little, caused no little sensation among the
inhabitants of that town. After their arrival in port,
Jones sent for the young pilot, and presenting him with a
piece of gold, expressed his pleasure at his expert seamanship,
which he had minutely watched during the towing
of his ship into the harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He also observed that he had made the port of Mandal,
in order to enlarge his crew, not having sufficient men for
the long cruise he was about to make; and added, that if
the father of the young pilot would permit, he would be
glad to engage him. Satisfactory arrangements were
made, and Johnson was received as a seaman on board
the <span class='it'>Ranger</span>. It will be remembered that Captain Jones
had been cruising the last two years as first lieutenant of
the <span class='it'>Alfred</span> flag ship, the first privateer fitted out by Congress
to cruise against British commerce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this ship he hoisted with his own hands the American
flag, the first time it was ever displayed on the ocean; its
emblems were a pine-tree, with a rattle-snake coiled at its
root, as if about to strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Alfred</span> was very successful, and had brought home
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
several valuable prizes. Congress, therefore, determined
on the purchase of three other ships for the same purpose,
and Captain Jones was permitted to make choice of either;
he chose the <span class='it'>Ranger</span>, and was invested with the command
by the following resolutions:</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Resolved</span>, “That Captain John Paul Jones be appointed
to command the ship <span class='it'>Ranger</span>, and that William Whipple,
Esq., member of Congress, and of the Marine Committee,
John Langdon, Esq., continental agent, and the said John
Paul Jones be authorized to appoint lieutenants and other
officers and men necessary for the said ship; and that
blank commissions and warrants be sent them to be filled
up with the names of the persons they appoint, returns
whereof to be made to the Navy Board in the eastern department.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Resolved</span>, That the flag of the thirteen United States,
henceforth be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white;
and the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing
a new constellation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jones immediately commissioned the <span class='it'>Ranger</span>, and, singular
to say, was the first to display the new flag of the
republic, as he did the original one on board the <span class='it'>Alfred</span>,
about two years previous. The <span class='it'>Ranger</span> was intended to
carry twenty-six guns; but Jones begged to exercise his
own judgment, believing that she would be more serviceable
with only eighteen, and accordingly mounted that
number, for which he had often occasion to congratulate
himself on his judicious forethought; for the ship proved
to be exceedingly crank, and with the whole number,
would have been nearly useless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His first cruise with his new ship was to the coast of
France, and on his voyage there he chased a fleet of ten
sail, under a strong convoy, took two prizes, and carried
them safely into Nantes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From thence he took a short cruise on the coast of Norway,
and putting into the port of Mandal, as we before
stated, engaged the services of Thomas Johnson, the subject
of this sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After completing his arrangement, Jones returned to
Nantes, and from thence proceeded to Quiberon Bay,
giving convoy to some American vessels which were desirous
of joining the French fleet commanded by Admiral
La Mott Piquet, who had been ordered to keep the coast
of France clear of British cruisers. Writing to the
Marine Committee on the 22d February, 1778, he says,
“I am happy in having it in my power to congratulate
you on seeing the American flag, for the first time, recognized
in the fullest and most complete manner by the flag
of France; and as it is my greatest desire to render useful
services to the American cause, I would suggest that, as
the field of cruising being thus extended, and the British
navy, in numbers, so superior to ours, it would be well to
surprise their defenceless places, and thereby divert their
attention, and draw it from our coasts.” These suggestions
contained the plan of annoyance which was eventually
adopted in Paul Jones’s cruisings in the European
seas. It was about the middle of April, 1778, so our hero
relates, that they found themselves on the coast of Scotland,
immediately in the vicinity of the birth-place of
Jones, and in sight of the port of Whitehaven, upon which
he had determined to make his first descent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near the break of day, when Jones ordered two
boats, and a plentiful supply of combustibles to be prepared,
with thirty-one men, to leave the <span class='it'>Ranger</span> and make
for the outer pier. Jones commanded the first boat himself,
the other was under the command of Simpson, his
first lieutenant, conveying the combustible matter, and
charged with firing the vessels, about seventy in number,
lying on the north side of the pier, while he undertook the
rest. They found two batteries at Whitehaven, which
Jones, with ten of his men, Johnson being one of the
number, scaled, taking the soldiers prisoners, and spiking
the guns. He then, with his party, started for the other
battery, about a quarter of a mile distant, which he served
in the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return he met his lieutenant, with the remainder
of the sailors, who stated that he had not done as he had
requested him, having a reluctance to destroy the undefended
property of poor people, he had hesitated until his
candles had burned out, and then found it impossible to
execute his orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jones was exceedingly angry, and vented his rage in
the most insulting language, saying at the same time,
“that if the accomplished Lord Howe would commit
deeds of burning, pillage, and slaughter, upon the persons
and property of Americans, the right of retaliation belonged
to us.” In making such hasty remarks, he forgot
that this enterprise was one of an entirely different nature;
the scheme, if it may be so called, was one of his own
forming, the American government not being apprised of
any thing of the kind, neither had he received any order
to that effect. The whole affair must be allowed to be
one of the most audacious of its kind, and will ever attach
a lasting stain upon the memory of its originator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was now daylight and the frightened inhabitants were
beginning to collect; still Jones was unwilling to depart
without carrying any of his intended depredations into
effect, after surmounting so many difficulties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He posted to the nearest house and demanded a light,
which, having obtained, he deliberately kindled a fire in
the steerage of a large ship which was surrounded by
others lying dry upon the shore, pouring a barrel of tar
into the flames; during this operation, Johnson, with several
other sailors, stood sentinel against any surprise he
might receive from the inhabitants, who by this time were
attracted by the flames, and had assembled to the pier in
great numbers. On seeing them approach in such formidable
numbers, he seized his pistols, one in each hand,
and standing between them and the ship on fire, ordered
them to retire to their homes, which they did with precipitation.
At length he and his party entered their boats
and rowed quietly to their ship, where, from the deck, he
could see the panic-stricken inhabitants running in vast
numbers to their forts, which was no little amusement to
him, as he had spiked their guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jones afterward ascertained, much to his chagrin, that
only the ship which he himself had fired was destroyed,
the surrounding ones were saved by the exertions of the
people. He consoled himself by saying, “that he had done
enough to show England that not all her boasted navy
could protect her own coasts, and that the scenes of distress
which she had caused the Americans to pass through,
might soon be brought home to her own doors.” On his
return to the <span class='it'>Ranger</span>, Jones informed his officers and men
that he had not yet done with Scotland, that he had another
project in his head, which he intended to carry into
effect; that was, to obtain possession of the person of the
Earl of Selkirk, a nobleman residing at Selkirk Abbey, on
a beautiful promontory called St. Mary’s Isle, running out
into the river Dee, and not more than two miles distant
from where they then were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jones conceived that if he could obtain possession of
this nobleman’s person, he could demand an exchange for
some distinguished American prisoner. He remained in
the bay of Kirkcudbright till the following morning, when
he started with two boats and about twenty men, among
whom was Johnson, who relates the particulars of this
singular adventure. Johnson was in the first boat with
Jones, who commanded it himself; the other was commanded
by Simpson, his first lieutenant. They landed on
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
part of the grounds, not more than two hundred yards
from the house; some laborers were at work near by, of
whom they inquired if Lord Selkirk was at home; they
were informed that he was in London, consequently, his
end was frustrated. On receiving this information they
prepared to return to their boats, when his officers, of
whom there were four, expressed a wish to repair to the
Abbey and demand the family plate, pleading as an excuse,
that it was the universal custom of the English on the
American coast. Jones, in his official report, says, after
some hesitation, he reluctantly consented, charging them
to insult no person on the premises, especially Lady Selkirk.
During this delicate embassy, Jones withdrew behind
some trees, where he could perceive what was going
on. Simpson, with ten of his sailors, went to the house.
Lady Selkirk was at breakfast when they presented themselves
at the window, and supposing them to be the crew
of a revenue cutter, sent a servant to inquire their business,
and to offer them some refreshment. Simpson entered
the room on the return of the servant, and stated his errand
to Lady Selkirk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her ladyship made no resistance, but sent the servant
to collect the remainder of the plate, requesting that the
teapot, which was then on the table, might be emptied and
placed with it. After being collected, it was carefully
packed in baskets, and the party, having performed their
errand, withdrew to their boats, where Paul Jones met
them. They soon regained their ship, when the prize they
had made was safely repacked, and they set sail for the
coast of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During their voyage from Scotland to France he fell in
with an English vessel called the <span class='it'>Drake</span>; a sharp conflict
ensued, which lasted more than an hour, when the
<span class='it'>Drake</span> surrendered, and was towed in safety into Brest,
a seaport of France. On the very day of his arrival at
Brest, Jones wrote the following eccentric epistle to Lady
Selkirk, which one of his biographers calls “the queerest
piece of epistolary correspondence extant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Madam</span>,—It cannot be too much lamented, that in the
profession of arms, the officer of fine feelings and real
sensibility, should be under the necessity of winking at
any action of persons under his command which his heart
cannot approve; but the reflection is doubly severe, when
he finds himself obliged, in appearance, to countenance
such actions by his authority. This hard case was mine,
when, on the 23d of April last, I landed on St. Mary’s
Isle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Knowing Lord Selkirk’s interest with his king, and
esteeming as I do his private character, I wished to make
him the happy instrument of alleviating the horrors of
hopeless captivity, when the brave are overpowered and
made prisoners of war. It was, perhaps, fortunate for
you, madam, that he was from home, for it was my intention
to have taken him on board the <span class='it'>Ranger</span>, and detained
him until, through his means, a general and fair exchange
of prisoners, as well in Europe as in America, had been
effected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was informed by some men whom I met at
landing, that his lordship was absent, I walked back to my
boat, determined to leave the island. By the way, however,
some officers who were with me could not forbear
expressing their discontent, observing that in America no
delicacy was shown by the English, who took away all
sorts of moveable property, setting fire not only to towns
and to the houses of the rich, without distinction, but not
even sparing the wretched hamlets and milch-cows of the
poor and helpless, at the approach of an inclement
winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That party had been with me at Whitehaven; some
complaisance, therefore, was their due. I had but a moment
to think how I might gratify them, and at the same
time do your ladyship the least injury. I charged the
officers to permit none of the seamen to enter the house,
or to hurt any thing about it; to treat you, madam, with
the utmost respect; to accept of the plate which was
offered, and to come away without making a search, or
demanding any thing else. I am induced to believe that I
was punctually obeyed, since I am informed that the plate
which they brought away is far short of the quantity expressed
in the inventory which accompanied it. I have
gratified my men; and when the plate is sold, I shall become
the purchaser, and will gratify my own feelings in
restoring it, by such conveyance as you may please to
direct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had the earl been on board the <span class='it'>Ranger</span> the following
evening, he would have seen the awful pomp and dreadful
carnage of a sea engagement; both affording ample subject
for the pencil as well as melancholy reflection for the contemplative
mind. Humanity starts back from such scenes
of horror, and cannot sufficiently execrate the vile promoters
of this detestable war;</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>For they, ’twas they unsheathed the ruthless blade,</p>
<p class='line0'>And Heaven shall ask the havoc it has made.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“The British ship of war <span class='it'>Drake</span>, mounting twenty
guns, with more than her full complement of officers and
men, was our opponent. The ships met, and the advantage
was disputed with great fortitude on each side for an
hour and four minutes, when the gallant commander of
the <span class='it'>Drake</span> fell, and victory declared in favor of the <span class='it'>Ranger</span>.
The amiable lieutenant lay mortally wounded, besides
near forty of the inferior officers and crew killed and
wounded; a melancholy demonstration of the uncertainty
of human prospects, and of the sad reverses of fortune,
which an hour can produce. I buried them in a spacious
grave, with the honors due to the memory of the brave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though I have drawn my sword in the present generous
struggle for the rights of men, yet I am not in arms
as an American, nor am I in pursuit of riches. My fortune
is liberal, having no wife nor family, and having lived
long enough to know that riches cannot secure happiness.
I profess myself a citizen of the world, totally unfettered
by the little, mean distinctions of climate or of country,
which diminish the benevolence of the heart and set
bounds to philanthropy. Before this war was begun, I had,
at an early time of life, withdrawn from sea-service in favor
of ‘calm contemplation and poetic ease.’ I have sacrificed
not only my favorite scheme of life, but the softer affections
of the heart, and my prospects of domestic happiness;
and I am ready to sacrifice my life also with cheerfulness,
if that forfeiture could restore peace among
mankind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As the feelings of your gentle bosom cannot but be
congenial with mine, let me entreat you, madam, to use
your persuasive art with your husband, to endeavor to
stop this cruel and destructive war, in which Britain can
never succeed. Heaven can never countenance the barbarous
and unmanly practice of Britons in America, which
savages would blush at, and which, if not discontinued,
will soon be retaliated on Britain by a justly enraged
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should you fail in this, and I am persuaded you will
attempt it, (and who can resist the power of such an advocate,)
your endeavors to effect a general exchange of
prisoners, will be an act of humanity, which will afford
you golden feelings on your death-bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope this cruel contest will soon be closed; but should
it continue, I wage no war with the fair. I acknowledge
their force, and bend before it with submission. Let not,
therefore, the amiable Countess of Selkirk regard me as
an enemy; I am ambitious of her esteem and friendship,
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
and would do any thing consistent with my duty to
merit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The honor of a line from your fair hand, in answer to
this, will lay me under singular obligation; and if I can
render you any acceptable service in France or elsewhere,
I hope you see into my character so far as to command me,
without the least grain of reserve. I wish to know the
exact behaviour of my people, as I am determined to
punish them if they have exceeded their liberty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This vain, Quixotic, and inexplicable epistle, is a perfect
illustration of the character of the writer; but with
all its egotism and chivalry, it did not produce the wished
for answer from the “fair hand of his amiable countess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not be for one moment supposed that Lady
Selkirk would condescend to answer a letter couched in
such terms of gross familiarity. The plate, after many
difficulties and delays, was finally restored, some seven
or eight years after it was taken. The French government
being at this time on the eve of embracing the
American cause, overwhelmed Jones with congratulations
upon his late achievements. He received a letter from the
French Minister, offering him the command of the <span class='it'>Bonhomme
Richard</span>, with permission to choose his own cruising
ground, either in the European or American seas, and
to cruise under the flag of the United States. Jones
accepted the offer, and accordingly prepared to form his
crew by enlisting raw French peasants and volunteers,
having only thirty Americans in the whole, these he transferred
from the <span class='it'>Ranger</span>, with Johnson, our veteran sailor.
He commenced his cruising on the coast of Norway, from
thence to the west coast of Ireland, during which he
made many valuable prizes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He now determined to cruise around the English coasts,
to intercept the colliers bound to London, many of which
he destroyed. It was during this cruise that he was joined
by the <span class='it'>Alliance</span>, the <span class='it'>Pallas</span>, and the <span class='it'>Vengeance</span>, these,
with the <span class='it'>Richard</span>, formed the squadron of which he was
commander. On the 23d of September the squadron was
standing to the northward, toward Flamboro Head, with
a light breeze, when they discovered a fleet of forty-one
sail running down the coast, very close in with the land.
Jones soon discovered that this was the Baltic fleet which
he had been so anxious to encounter, but had never before
had the chance. This fleet was under convoy of the
<span class='it'>Serapis</span>, a new ship, mounting forty-four guns, and the
<span class='it'>Countess of Scarborough</span>, of twenty guns. Early in the
evening the <span class='it'>Serapis</span> was observed to haul round and place
herself between her convoy and the <span class='it'>Richard</span>, as if preparing
to engage her; she soon came within pistol-shot,
when the captain of the <span class='it'>Serapis</span> demanded, “What ship
is that?” and in reply, a shot was fired from the <span class='it'>Richard</span>.
This was the commencement of a battle more famous for
stubborn courage and heroic daring than perhaps the world
ever knew. The biographers of this eccentric but gallant
officer have so often described this triumphant conflict,
that we shall content ourselves with a few incidents
with which our veteran sailor was more immediately
connected. He relates that the <span class='it'>Richard</span> suffered severely
at the first of the battle, till Jones ordered his ship to be
laid across the hawse of the enemy; in doing so the two
ships swung broadside and broadside, the muzzles of the
guns touching each other. Jones sent one of his men to
lash the two ships together, and commenced with his own
hand in making fast the jib-stay of the <span class='it'>Serapis</span> to the
<span class='it'>Richard’s</span> mizenmast; when the sailors saw what he was
about to do, Johnson, with two others, ran to his assistance,
and soon performed the task. The firing continued
from the starboard sides of both vessels for more than an
hour, the effect of which was terrible to both ships. There
was much skirmishing with pistols and pikes through the
ports, but no effort was made from the <span class='it'>Serapis</span> to board the
<span class='it'>Richard</span>, although they must have observed her crippled
condition, she had begun to leak fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was near ten o’clock when the <span class='it'>Richard</span> had sunk
considerably from the water she had received through
the shot-holes, which was now below the surface.
Some of the subordinate officers believing that she was
sinking, cried out lustily for “Quarter!” when Jones,
in great anger, threw a pistol at one of them, which he
had just discharged at the enemy, fractured the poor fellow’s
skull, and sent him reeling down the hatchway.
Jones ordered all the hands that could be spared to the
pumps, and shortly after the <span class='it'>Serapis</span> surrendered. At
this moment there was much confusion, as several of the
crew, who were Englishmen, and near their homes, took
advantage of the <span class='it'>mêlée</span> to desert in a small boat toward
<span class='it'>Scarborough</span>. Our hero well remembers seeing one of
the lieutenants of the <span class='it'>Richard</span> appear on the deck and
present several of the officers of the <span class='it'>Serapis</span> to Commodore
Jones as prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The action had now ceased, all hands were ordered to
assist in separating the two ships which had been so long
in deadly embrace, and to extinguish the flames which
were now raging in both vessels. It was daylight in the
morning when the carpenters were ordered to examine the
<span class='it'>Richard</span>. After a deliberate examination, they were of
opinion that she could not be kept afloat sufficiently long
to reach any port. Jones was not willing to abandon her
till the last moment, and kept a lieutenant with a party of
sailors at the pumps for twenty-four hours; Johnson says
he worked for nine successive hours, and at last, when
all hopes were extinguished, they commenced removing
the wounded and the stores to the <span class='it'>Serapis</span>. They had
not finished their operations more than half an hour, when
she sunk to rise no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next cruise was to the Texel, and from thence to
Amsterdam, where they received great kindness from the
Dutch. Jones still continued his cruising with satisfaction
to the American government until the beginning of
the year 1781, when he was sent with the ship <span class='it'>Ariel</span> to
Philadelphia with stores for the army which had been
waiting in France for more than a year, no suitable conveyance
having been provided. They arrived in Philadelphia
in February, 1781, the first time Johnson had seen
the land of his adoption. Here he received his prize
money, and having disengaged himself from the <span class='it'>Ariel</span>, determined
to remain a short time in order to become master
of the English language, of which at that time he knew
but little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time Congress was sitting in Philadelphia, and
several of the members were about removing their families
to that city. Application was made to Captain
Jones to furnish a man to take charge of a sloop to Boston,
to convey the furniture of John Adams to Philadelphia;
he accordingly appointed Johnson, and he brought the
furniture safely to that city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This circumstance often brought Johnson in contact
with Mr. Adams, who knew that he was one of the crew
of Captain Jones, and consequently must have been in the
conflict of the <span class='it'>Serapis</span> and <span class='it'>Richard</span>, which having occurred
so recently, was a subject of general conversation.
Many of the sailors frequented the hall of Congress, and
Johnson became interested in listening and observing what
was so new to him that he was a daily visiter. When
the members found that the sailors were part of the crew
of Captain Jones, they frequently left their seats, and
came over to them to inquire the particulars of the recent
engagement. Mr. Adams particularly engaged the attention
of Johnson; to use the veteran’s own words, he says,
“a nervous sensation seemed to pervade the patriot as he
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
listened to the description of the battle given by the
sailors, fire flashed from his eyes, and his hair seemed
perfectly erect;” he would clasp his hands, and exclaim,
“What a scene!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the time they remained in Philadelphia, General
Washington arrived, and was presented to Congress;
Johnson was present and listened to the introduction by
President Hancock, and the reply by the general. Some
days after, when the sailors were in the hall, Mr. Adams
brought General Washington to them, who kindly shook
each by the hand, calling them “Our gallant tars!” and
asking them questions relative to the many successful adventures
they had recently achieved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Johnson soon after left the navy, and engaged in the
merchant service for some years, but eventually returned
to it again, where he remained till, near the end of his life’s
voyage, age obliged him to ask repose and protection
in that asylum provided for the grateful and worn-out
mariner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How few in our day have read the pious verses of
George Herbert, “the sweet singer of The Temple,” as his
biographer, old Walton, so loves to call him—verses overflowing
with the sensibilities of a heart consecrated to
pious uses, all aglow with love for humanity, and an
ardent desire to bring it nearer to Him who so freely gave
himself for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sweet George Herbert! Who that has ever read the
rich outpourings of your warm and pious spirit, but has
felt how poor and cold in the comparison were the promptings
of his own? Who that has ever pondered over your
verse, radiant with the praises of that sanctuary in whose
hallowed courts you so loved to tread, but has felt the
full force of your own sweet words?</p>

<p class='line0'>A verse may find him who a sermon flies,</p>
<p class='line0'>And turn delight into a sacrifice.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>George Herbert, the author of “The Temple,” a collection
of sacred poems, was of a most noble, generous, and
ancient family. His brother was the famous Edward
Lord Herbert, of Cherbury, who was himself a poet, but
attained higher distinction as a statesman and historian,
having filled, during the reign of James I., the responsible
posts of privy counselor, and ambassador to France; it
was while engaged in the duties of this embassy that he
composed his famous history of Henry the Eighth, so often
quoted and referred to by the modern English historian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of our sketch was born at Montgomery
Castle, in Wales, April 3, 1593. He was educated at
Westminster school, and being a king’s scholar, was
elected to Trinity College, Cambridge, about the year 1608.
He took both degrees in the Arts, and became a Fellow
in the college. In 1619 he was chosen orator for the University,
which post he held eight years. This office he
is said to have filled with great honor to himself and to the
University. And this was no wonder, for, to use the
quaint language of his biographer, old Izaak Walton, “he
had acquired great learning, and was blessed with a high
fancy, a civil and sharp wit, and with a natural elegance
both in his behaviour, his tongue, and his pew.” When
that royal pedant, King James, published his “Basilicon
Doron,” he sent a copy to the University of Cambridge.
Herbert, in his capacity as orator, was called upon to acknowledge
its receipt on behalf of the institution, which
he did in a most elegant manner, by a letter written in
Latin, closing with the following lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote0r9'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>Quid vaticanam <a id='bod'></a>Bodleianamque objicis hospes!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Unicus<a id='uni'></a> est nobis Bibliotheca Liber.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The excellence of its Latinity, and the complimentary
allusions plentifully sprinkled through it, so pleased the
vanity of the king, that he inquired of the Earl of Pembroke
if he knew the learned scholar who penned the
epistle. His answer was, “That he knew him very well,
and that he was his kinsman; but that he loved him more
for his learning and virtue, than that he was of his name
and family.” At which answer the king smiled, and
asked the earl leave that he might love him too, for he took
him to be the jewel of that University.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The complimentary remark of the king, coming to the
ears of Herbert, no doubt first turned his thoughts toward
court preferment; for about this time we find him
applying himself to the study of the Italian, French, and
Spanish languages, in which he is said to have attained
great proficiency; and by means of the attainment of which,
to use his own language, “he hoped to secure the place
of Secretary of State, as his predecessor, Sir Francis
Nethersole had done.” This, and the love of court conversation,
with the laudable ambition to be something
more than he then was, drew him often from Cambridge
to attend his majesty, King James.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after this the king visited Cambridge in state,
and was received on behalf of the University by Herbert,
in a most elegant oration in Latin, stuffed full, as the
manner of the time then was, of most fulsome adulation.
In his progress he was attended by the great Sir Francis
Bacon, Lord Verulam, and by the learned Dr. Andrews,
Bishop of Winchester; and Herbert, by his learning and
suavity, soon captivated these distinguished men. Bacon
seems afterward to have put such value upon his judgment,
that he usually desired his approbation before he
would expose any of his books to be printed, and thought
him so worthy of his friendship, that having translated
many of the Prophet David’s Psalms into English verse,
he made George Herbert his Patron, by a public dedication
of them to him as the “best judge of divine poetry.”
In 1620, the king gave Herbert a sinecure, formerly conferred
upon Sir Philip Sydney by Queen Elizabeth, worth
some twelve hundred pounds per annum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His ambitious views of further court preferment seem
never to have been realized. The character of his mind,
perhaps, did not fit him for the responsible duties of a
statesman, or he might have been deficient in those arts
of the courtier, so necessary, and such ready aid to court
preferment. It may be that he had too independent a
spirit, and could not “crook the pregnant hinges of the
knee, that thrift might follow fawning.” But be this as
it may, we think, in the sentiment contained in some
verses written by our poet about the period of his leaving
the court and entering holy orders, we have a readier solution
for the sudden relinquishment of his hopes of court
preferment. These verses were written upon the famous
saying of Cardinal Wolsey, uttered by that proud churchman
when his spirit was crushed, and the fruits of his
ambition had turned to ashes on his lips. “Oh, that I had
served my God with half the zeal with which I have
served my king, he would not thus, in my old age, have
placed me in the power of mine enemies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No doubt the wholesome reflections inspired by the
contemplation of those touching words, awakened the
sensitive mind of our poet to a full appreciation of the
vanity of all earthly ambition. He discovered in time,
that pleasures springing from honor and grandeur of condition,
are soon faded; that the mind nauseates, and soon
begins to feel their emptiness. In the words of one of
England’s most gifted divines, “Those who are so fond of
public honor while they pursue it, how little do they taste
it when they have it? Like lightning it only flashes on
the face, and it is well if it do not hurt the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without further speculating as to the reasons that induced
our poet to fly from the court circles into the quiet
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>
retreat of the pastor’s life, most certain it is, about the
year 1629, we find him renouncing the pomp and vanities
of earthly ambition, and entering into holy orders. Previous
to his induction, we find him using the following
language in a letter to a friend: “I now look back upon
my aspiring thoughts, and think myself more happy than
if I had attained what then I so ambitiously thirsted for;
and now I can behold the court with an impartial eye, and
see plainly that it is made up of graced titles, and flattery,
and many other such empty imaginary painted pleasures—pleasures
that are so empty as not to satisfy where they
are enjoyed. But in God and his service is a fullness of
all joy and pleasure, but no satiety.” Of the fervency of
his piety we have a most beautiful exemplification in some
of his poems published about this time, especially in that
styled “The Odor,” in which he seems to rejoice in the
thought of the word “Jesus,” and say that the adding of
these words “my master,” to it “seemed to perfume his
mind, and leave an oriental fragrance in his very breath.”
Alluding, in another poem, to his “unforced choice to
serve at God’s altar,” he says,</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1630 he was admitted to the priestly office, and was
immediately inducted to the Rectory of Bemerton, near
Salisbury. And here it was, stripping from him the
gaudy trappings of a fashionable court, he clothed himself
in the better and more enduring robes of humility and
meekness. It was here, amid the quiet shades of his
peaceful parish, he prepared, for his own use and that of
his brethren, a brief manual, entitled “The Country
Parson”—the rich gatherings of his own experience, and
the exemplification of his own ardor in the performance
of the duties of the pastoral office. His sermons, delivered
while at Bemerton, are practical in doctrine, forcible in
illustration, and make directly to the heart. They are
just such sermons as we should suppose the author of The
Country Parson would preach. They are many of them
explanatory of the forms and services of the Church of England,
urging their importance and the necessity of their
being truly understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He usually took his text from the gospel of the day appointed
to be read, and did as consistently declare why
the Church did appoint that portion of Scripture to be that
day read; and he shortly made it appear to them (to use
his own words) “that the whole service of the Church
was a reasonable, and therefore an acceptable sacrifice to
God—as, namely, we begin with confession of ourselves
to be vile and miserable sinners; and we begin so because,
until we have confessed ourselves to be such, we are
not capable of that mercy which we so much need; but
having in the prayer of our Lord begged pardon for those
sins which we have confessed, and hoping by our public
confession and real repentance we have obtained that
pardon—then we dare and do proceed to beg of the Lord
‘to open our lips, that our mouth may show forth his
praise;’ for till then we are not able and worthy to
praise him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The church holydays and fasts, and the benefits to be
derived from their observance, were most beautifully
illustrated in Herbert’s discourses; and we venture to say
that in the sermons of no clergyman of the Church of
England, or the Episcopal Church of America, can there
be found so practical and so beautiful an exemplification
of the excellency of the Episcopal Church service. The
simple parishioners of Bemerton learned to love the
service of their church under the preachings of their
sainted pastor, because its practical usefulness, and its
adaptation to their every spiritual want, was brought
forcibly home to the door of their hearts. The form, they
were taught, was as nothing, save as the most fitting
vehicle of their wants and spiritual aspirations. In our
age, where the cold religion of formality is seen struggling
for the mastery over that which is ardent and spiritual;
when “the outward and visible sign” seems to be more
thought of than “the inward and spiritual grace;” when
the outward adornments of the sanctuary are held almost
in as high value, and as necessary to salvation, as the
inward adornment of the meek and pious spirit, it is refreshing
to read such sermons as those of Herbert. He
was a formalist only so far as form could be made a means
to an end; a means to bring man to a closer contemplation
of the love and the abounding mercies of his God; a means
through which he could be made to praise him in holiness
and truth. The form he looked upon as the fitting vehicle,
“the silken twist,” to lead man’s thoughts in fit expression
up to the throne of God. The summum bonum, the
all in religion, he still believed, and so most earnestly
taught, consisted in the free-will offering of the penitent
and pious spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his essay on the duties of the Country Parson, he
enjoins upon the pastor, “to be constant in every good
work, setting such an example to his flock as they may
be glad to follow; and by so doing, profit thereby to their
souls’ good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And most diligently (if we are to believe the testimony
of his contemporaries) did George Herbert conform himself
to the character so beautifully sketched. In the functions
of his humble office he is said to have led a most pious
and blameless life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priests of the Levitical ministration, put on the
humerus blazing with jewels, before they took the breastplate
of righteousness and truth; thereby signifying that
the priest must be a shining light, resplendent with good
works, before he fed them with righteousness and truth,
the legitimate milk of the word. And in the daily beauty
of his blameless life; in the gentle, dove-like spirit that
animated his every motive; in his daily charities, and his
devout ministerings at the altar, Herbert most beautifully
illustrated the doctrines that he preached. His life was
“indeed, a shining light, resplendent with good works;”
and the flock which he so faithfully tended, found through
his guidance spiritual pastures. Quaint old Jeremy
Taylor, alluding to the necessity of the Christian pastor
exemplifying in his daily life the doctrines that he preaches,
most beautifully remarks:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Herod’s doves could never have invited so many
strangers to their dovecots if they had not been besmeared
with most fragrant ointment. As said Dydimus, make
your pigeons smell sweet, and they will allure whole
flocks. And, Christian pastor, if your life be excellent, your
virtues, ‘like precious ointment, full of fragrance,’ you will
soon invite your charges to run after your precious odors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such, in all things, was the subject of our sketch; his
virtues were the precious ointment, full of fragrance,
alluring the quiet flock his Master had given him to feed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have said more of Herbert in his pastoral character
than we first intended, although, perhaps, we have not
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
dwelt upon it too long to give an illustration of the beautiful
simplicity and pious ardor of the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the quiet village of Bemerton that Herbert
composed his little volume of poems, styled “The
Temple,” of which it was said by a contemporary,
“There was in it the picture of a divine soul in every
page, and the whole book was such a harmony of holy passions,
as would enrich the world with pleasure and piety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not pretend to claim for these songs any great
poetic merit. They abound with faults, such as were peculiar
to most of the minor poets of that age. The versification
is often rough and inharmonious, the words ill
chosen for the rhyme, while conceits far-fetched and unnatural
are most plentifully sprinkled through them.
These, however, are faults peculiar to the versification of
the time in which our poet flourished. The great merit
of these songs, most undoubtedly, consists mainly in the
pious ardor and genuine devotional feeling which characterize
them. The reader is attracted at once by the deep
and earnest piety they manifest. There seems to be a
consistent effort in the poet’s mind to give utterance to his
devotional feeling in words of earnestness and power, such
words as shall not dishonor the high and noble theme he
had chosen for his subject. It can readily be discovered
that they give utterance to the language of his heart, and
that the influence of that heart’s holiest affections was the
happiest inspiration of his verse. If there is any truth
in those sweet lines of Cowper,</p>

<p class='noindent'>then “sweet George Herbert” has made sure his claim
to remembrance, and left something behind him which
posterity will not willingly let die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wherever deep and holy love for sacred things is
esteemed, there the verses of Herbert will find many
ardent admirers. They are the pure and free-will offerings
of a heart consecrated to pious uses, and attuned to sacred
harmonies—the soft breathings of a devotional spirit, that
seems too pure for earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he sings of the church where he so loved to
worship, it is with all the earnest enthusiasm, if not with
the inspiration of that noble song of Solomon, commencing,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold thou art fair, my love, behold thou art fair; thou
hast dove’s eyes within thy locks, thy hair is as a flock
of goats that appear from Mount Gilead. Thy lips are
like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely; thy
temples are like a piece of pomegranate within thy locks,
thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot within thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Herbert loved the church, because it was the fold
where he could gather the flock that had been given him
to tend. The church on earth was to him the emblem of
the spiritual church “eternal in the heavens.” His
gentle spirit seems all aglow with love, whenever he
sings of its quiet retreats and the rich solemnities of its
glorious worship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poems, styled “The Temple,” are preceded by a
long poem as a preface, called “The Church Porch,”
where he would have the reader linger before entering
the sanctuary. And in the poem the poet takes occasion
to give sage counsel and most excellent advice, the better
to fit the mind for the contemplation of the sacredness of
the sanctuary beyond the porch. He would purify the
spirit from the dross of earthly vices, he would have it
“purged of the contaminations of earth,” before entering
the temple, where the divine presence loves to dwell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And no one who will read the advice embodied in this
introductory poem, but must rise from its perusal with
the conviction that it contains a code of morality, enforced
by most excellent precepts. Independent of its religious
tone, it may be said to contain the very best of principles,
enforced by illustrations that carry conviction to the mind
at once. In the rude measure of the time, it holds up
virtue in all its beauty to our approbation, and lays bare
all the hideousness of vice. He seeks not for harmonious
verse, as the vehicle of thought, he desires not to please,
but to persuade; not to amuse, but to instruct.</p>

his poetical, and clearly entitle him to rank with the best

character of our poet, has never been surpassed in any
age. His disposition was of the most sweet and engaging
nature, adorned with all the graces of a most saint-like
piety. “He lived like a saint,” says his enthusiastic
biographer, old Walton, “and like a saint did he die.”

as Indian Summer, the Mallard, and the two beautiful
species which we have placed at the head of this
article, begin to make their appearance on the little lakes
of the interior, and in the various streams and rivers
which fall into them, and thence downward to the Atlantic
seaboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the vast northern solitudes of the great lakes of the
northwest, in all the streams of Upper Canada, even to
the feeders of Lake Superior, and throughout the western
country so far south as Texas, and northward to the
Columbia and the fur countries, the Blue-Winged Teal
breeds, literally by myriads. Throughout the great lakes,
it is abundant in the early autumn, becoming excessively
fat on the seed of the wild rice, with which the shallows
of all those waters are overgrown, and being deservedly
esteemed as one of the best, if not the very best, of the
duck tribe. But it is the first of its race to remove from
the wild, limpid waters, and wood-embosomed rivers of
the great west, to the seaboard tide-waters, taking the
inland water-courses on their route, rarely visiting the
actual sea-shores, and proceeding on the occurrence of the
first frosts, for they are singularly susceptible of cold, to
the Southern States, where they swarm, especially in the
inundated rice-fields of Georgia and South Carolina, during
the winter months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Green-Winged Teal, which is the nearest congener,
and frequently the associate of the Blue-Wing, has a far
less extensive range, so far as regards its breeding-grounds,
in as much as it never, so far as has been satisfactorily
shown, has nidificated or produced its young south of the
Great Lakes, nor even there in great numbers, its favorite
haunts, for the purposes of reproduction, being the extreme
northern swamps and wooded morasses almost up
to the verge of the arctic circles. It does not come down
on its southward migration, at nearly so early a period of
the autumn as its congener, being less susceptible of cold,
and tarrying on the Great Lakes till the frosts set in with
sufficient severity to prevent its frequenting its favorite
haunts with pleasure, or obtaining its food with facility.
It is rarely or never seen in the Middle States during the
summer, but is tolerably abundant during the autumn on
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
all the marshy lakes and pools, and along the shores of all
the reedy rivers from the great lakes downward to the sea-board,
though, like the last named species, it is purely a
fresh-water duck, never frequenting the sea-shores or
salt bays, finding no food thereon with which to gratify
its delicate and fastidious palate, which, eschewing fish,
the larvæ of insects, and the lesser <span class='it'>crustaceæ</span>, relishes
only the seeds of the various water plants and grasses,
the tender leaves of some vegetables, and more especially
the grain of the wild rice, <span class='it'>Zizania panicula effusa</span>, which
is its favorite article of subsistence, and one to which
may be ascribed the excellence of every bird of air or
water which feeds on it, from the Rice-Bird and the Rail,
to the Teal, the Canvas-Back, and even the large Thick-Billed
<span class='it'>Fuligula</span>, closely allied to the Scoter, the Velvet
Duck, and other uneatable sea-fowl of Lake Huron,
which are scarcely, if at all, inferior to the Red Heads of
Chesapeake Bay, the Gunpowder, or the Potomac. On
the Susquehanna and the Delaware, both these beautiful
little ducks were in past years excessively abundant, so
that a good gunner, paddling one of the sharp, swift skiffs
peculiar to those waters, was certain of filling his boat
with these delicious ducks within a few hours’ shooting.
Both of these species are rather tame than otherwise, the
blue-winged bird more particularly, which has a habit, on
the lower waters of the Delaware especially, of congregating
on the mud in vast flocks, sunning themselves in
the serene and golden light of a September noon, so careless
and easy of approach, that the gunner is frequently
enabled to paddle his skiff within a few yards of them, and
to rake them with close discharges of his heavy batteries.
At times, when the tide is out, and the birds are assembled
on the flats out of gunshot from the water’s edge, the
thorough-going sportsman, reckless of wet feet or muddy
breeches, will run his skiff ashore, several hundred yards
above or below the flock, and getting cautiously overboard,
will push it before him over the smooth, slippery mud-flats,
keeping himself carefully concealed under its stern until
within gunshot, which he can sometimes reduce to so little
as fifteen or twenty yards, by this murderous and stealthy
method. The Green-Winged Teal is much less apt to congregate,
especially on shore, than the other, and consequently,
affords less sport to the boat-shooter, keeping for
the most part afloat in little companies, or trips, as they are
technically called, very much on the alert, and springing
rapidly on the wing when disturbed. They, and the Blue-Wings
also, fly very rapidly, dodging occasionally on the
wing, not unlike to a wild, sharp-flying Woodcock, and
when they alight, darting downward with a short, sudden
twist among the reeds or rushy covert, exactly after the
fashion of the same bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commoner and, in our opinion—where these birds
are abundant either along the courses of winding drains
or streamlets, or in large reedy marshes, with wet soil
and occasional pools or splashes—far the more exciting
way of killing them is to go carefully and warily on foot,
with a good medium-sized double-gun, say of eight to ten
pounds weight, and a thoroughly well broke and steady
spaniel, to retrieve and occasionally to flush the birds,
which will sometimes, though rarely, lie very hard. A
good sportsman will frequently, thus late in the autumn,
when the mornings are sharp and biting, and the noons
warm and hazy, but before the ice makes, pick up, on
favorable ground, his eight or nine couple in a day’s
walking, with a chance of picking up at the same time a
few Snipe, Golden Plovers, Curlew, or Godwit; and this,
in our mind, is equal to slaughtering a boat load by sneaking
up in ambush to within twenty yards of a great company,
whistling to make them lift their heads and ruffle
up their loosened plumage, so as to give easy entrance to
the shot, and then pouring into them at half point-blank
range, a half pound of heavy shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the southern States they are commonly taken, says
Wilson, “in vast numbers, in traps placed on the small
dry eminences that here and there rise above the water of
the inundated rice fields. These places are strewed with
rice, and by the common contrivance called a figure four,
they are caught alive in hollow traps.” This we, of
course, merely mention as illustrative of the habits of the
bird; for, of course, no sportsman would dream of resorting
to so worse than poacher-like a proceeding. The mode
described by the eloquent pioneer of American natural history,
is probably practised, for the most part, by the negroes
for the supply of their masters’ table, and furnishing
their own pockets with a little extra change, and is not
used by the planters as a means of sport or amusement.
It must be remembered, also, that Wilson, than whom
there is no writer more to be relied on in matters which
he relates of his own knowledge, and as occurring in his
own days, must often be taken <span class='it'>cum grano salis</span>, as to the
numbers of birds slain in this way or that within a certain
time—things which he records, probably, on hearsay, and
on which—we are sorry to say it—even good sportsmen,
men who on any other subject would scorn to deviate one
hair’s breadth from the truth, will not hesitate to draw a
bow as long and as strong as Munchausen’s. Again, he
writes of times when sporting was but little pursued,
otherwise than as a method of procuring superior food for
the table, or for the purpose of destroying noxious vermin
and beasts of prey; when the rules of sportsmanship were
little understood and as little regarded; and, lastly, when
game abounded to a degree literally inconceivable in our
day—although we have ourselves seen, with sorrow, the
diminution, amounting in many regions around our large
cities almost to extinction, of all birds and beasts—nay,
but even fish of chase, within the last twenty years. We
must be careful therefore not to charge exaggeration on
a writer who, beyond a doubt, faithfully recorded that
which he himself saw and enjoyed in his day; which we
might see likewise and enjoy in our generation, and our
children and grand-children after us, if it were not for the
greedy, stupid, selfish, and brutal pot-hunting propensities
of our population, alike rural of the country and mechanical
of the cities, which seems resolutely and of set purpose
bent on the utter annihilation of every species of
game, whether of fur, fin or feather, which is yet found
within our boundaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my opinion, the common error of all American fowlers
and duck shooters, lies, in the first place, in the overloading
the gun altogether, causing it to recoil so much
as to be exceedingly disagreeable and even painful, and in
the same degree diminishing the effect of the discharge;
for it must never be forgotten that when a gun recoils,
whatever force is expended on the retrogressive motion of
the breech, that same force is to be deducted from the
propulsion of the charge. In the second place, he erroneously
loads with extremely large and heavy shot, the result
of which is, in two respects, inferior to that of a
lighter and higher number. First, as there will be three
or four pellets of No. 4 for every one pellet of A or B in
a charge, and, consequently, as the load is thereby so
much the more regularly distributed, and so much the
more likely to strike the object, and that in several places
more, in the ratio of three or four to one, than could be
effected by A’s or B’s. Second, as the flesh will constantly
close over the wound made by a small shot, so as
to cause the bleeding to go on internally to the engorgement
of the tissues and suffocation by hemorrhage; whereas
the wound made by the large grain will relieve itself
by copious bleeding, and the bird so injured will oftentimes
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
recover, after having fallen even to the surface of
the water, or lain flapping, as it were, in the death-struggle
on the blood-stained sand or grassy hassocks. This
fact has been well noticed, and several examples adduced
to prove its truth, by Mr. Giraud, in his exceedingly clear
and correct, though, to our taste, far too brief volume on
the “Birds of Long Island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For my own use I invariably adopt for all the smaller
species of duck—as the two varieties of Teal, the Summer
Duck, the Golden Eye, and the Buffel-headed Duck, <span class='it'>Anates</span>,
<span class='it'>Carolinensis</span>, <span class='it'>Discors</span>, <span class='it'>Sponsa</span>, and <span class='it'>Fuligulæ</span>, <span class='it'>Clanguid</span>,
and <span class='it'>Albeola</span>—the same shot which is generally used
for the various birds known on our shores and rivers as
bay-snipe, viz: No. 4 or 5—the latter best for the Plovers,
the former for duck, whether in large or small guns. In
this relation I may observe that, on one occasion—the only
one, by the way, on which I ever saw a green-winged
teal in the summer season—I killed a couple of these beautiful
birds, right and left, while woodcock shooting, in
Orange County, New York, with No. 8 shot. They
sprang quite unexpectedly from behind a willow bush, on
the Wuwayanda creek, and I dropped them both quite
dead, some what to my own astonishment, and to the
utter astounding of Fat Tom, who witnessed it, into the
middle of the stream, respectively at twenty and twenty-five
yards distance. Until I recovered them I supposed
that they were young wood ducks, but on examination
they proved to be young green-winged teal, of that season,
in their immature plumage. This must have been in
the last week of July or the first of August—it was many
years since, and as at that time I kept no shooting diary,
I unfortunately am unable to verify the exact date. The
birds must, I conclude, have been bred in that vicinity,
by what means I cannot conjecture, unless that the parent
birds might have been wounded in the spring, and
disabled from completing their northern migration, and
that this, as is some times the case with the minor birds
of passage, might have superinduced their breeding in
that, for them, far southern region. In corroboration of
this I may add that, in the spring of 1846, a couple of these
birds haunted a small reedy island in front of my house,
on the Passaic, to so late a day in summer—the 29th, if I
do not err, of May—that I sedulously avoided disturbing
them, in the hope that they would breed there. This I
yet think would have been the case but for the constant
disturbance of that lovely river throughout the summer by
gangs of ruffianly loafers, with whom the neighboring
town of Newark abounds beyond any other town of its
size in the known world, boating upon its silvery surface
day and night, and rendering day and night equally hideous
with their howls and blasphemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before proceeding to the description of these birds it
is well to observe that it will be found the better way, in
approaching them, as indeed <span class='it'>all</span> wild fowl, to work, if
possible, up wind to them; not that wild fowl have <a id='havethe'></a>the
power, as some pretend, of scenting the odor of the
human enemy on the tainted gale, as is undoubtedly the
case with deer and many other quadrupeds, but that their
hearing is exceedingly acute, and that their heads are
pricked up to listen, at the occurrence of the least unusual
sound, and at the next moment—<span class='it'>hey, presto!</span>—they are
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little cut at the head of this paper, for his spirited
and faithful execution of which the author and artist must
be permitted to return his acknowledgments to his friend,
Mr. Brightly, represents a favorite feeding ground of the
various tribes of water fowl, as is indicated by the large
gaggle of geese passing over, from right to left, and the
trip of green-wings alighting to the call of a clamorous
drake in the background. On a rocky spur of the shore,
in the right foreground, is a male Green-Winged Teal, in
the act of springing, with his legs already gathered under
him; and, still nearer to the front of the picture, on the
right, a Blue-Winged Drake, swimming on the limpid
water, soliciting his congener, with reverted neck, and
the harsh gabble—whence his name—to take wing and
greet the new-comers—it being the object of the draftsman
to give an idea not merely of the markings and form
of these two most beautiful and graceful of the duck tribe,
but of their motions, the character of their flights, and the
nature of their feeding grounds and habitations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head of the Green-Winged Teal is of moderate size
and compressed; the bill nearly as long as the head, deeper
than broad at the base, depressed at the tip; neck slender,
of moderate length; body full and depressed; wings rather
small, feet short and rather far back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plumage is short and blended; that of the hinder
head and neck elongated into a soft filamentous drooping
crest. The bill is black; iris hazel; feet light blue; head
and upper part of neck bright chestnut brown; a broad
band of shining rich bottle-green, narrowings from the eye
backward and downward to the nape, margined below
with black, anterior to which is a white line; chin dusky
brown. Upper parts and flanks white, beautifully and
closely undulated with narrow lines of deep gray. Anterior
to the wings is a broad transverse lunated white bar—<span class='it'>this
alone distinguishing the American from the European
bird</span>. The wing coverts, scapulars and quills gray.
The speculum bright green above, blue-black below, margined
posteriorly with pure white. Tail brownish gray,
margined with paler brown. Lower part of the neck undulated,
like the back. Breast pale rufous, spotted and
banded with black; white below. Abdomen white, barred
with gray. A black patch under the tail; the lateral tail
coverts tawny, the larger black, white-tipped and margined.
Length of male bird, 14¾.24. Female, 13¾.22½.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The description and drawing of this bird are taken, by
kind permission, which the writer gratefully acknowledges,
from a fine specimen in the Academy of Natural
Science of this city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Blue-Winged Teal is rather larger than the above,
the male measuring 16.31½, the female 15.24.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shape and proportions of this bird closely resemble
those of the latter, but in plumage it widely differs from
it. The bill is blueish black; iris dark hazel; feet dull
yellow, webs dusky; upper part of the head black, a
semilunar patch of pure white, margined with black anterior
to the eye; the rest of the head and upper neck deep
purplish gray, with changeable ruddy reflections. The
lower hind neck, back, alula, and upper parts generally,
rich chocolate brown, every feather margined with paler
tints, from reddish buff to pale reddish gray, with black
central markings, changing to metallic green in the centres.
Upper wing coverts rich ultra-marine blue, with
a metallic lustre; the lower parts pale reddish orange,
shaded on the breast with purplish red, and thickly spotted
with roundish or eliptical black spots; axillary
feathers, lower wing coverts, and a patch on the side
of the rump, pure white; lower tail coverts brownish
black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These, with the exception of the Buffel-Headed Duck,
are the two smallest; with the exception of the Summer
Duck, the two loveliest; with the exception of the Canvas-Back
the two best of the duck tribe. Well met be
they, whether on the board or in the field—shot be they
with No. 4—eaten roast, underdone, with cayenne and a
squeeze of a lemon, lubricated with red wine, <span class='it'>quantum
suff.</span></p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Amateur Concerts—Difference between Stage Singing and
Chamber Singing—Effect produced by Stage Acting on
the Manners and Conversation in Private—Origin of the
modern florid style of singing—Conclusion.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Concerts are popular all over the Union, but in no other
town are they so successful and popular as in Philadelphia.
We have here all kinds of these entertainments, Ethiopian
Concerts—Donation Concerts—Society Concerts, such as
the Musical Fund and Philharmonic—and pre-eminent
above all others, in point of fashion, Amateur Concerts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A small, good Opera Troupe, it is true, would be of
more service to our musical taste; for this hearing the
works of great masters by bits, as it were, is not of much
benefit; however, so that we have music in some manner
is better than not to have it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concerts of the past winter were all well attended;
but the Amateur Concerts were the favorites, and were,
indeed, very successful. The amateurs, both ladies and
gentlemen, surprised their audiences; and great praise is
due to “<span class='it'>Maestro Perelli</span>.” We have heard some of them
execute pieces in a manner that would have done credit
to a professional singer. But while we admired, we felt
a little disposed to remonstrate, for one or two old-fashioned
reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If they are really amateurs, and are training their voices
for private singing, are they not running a risk of injuring
their style by singing in public?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the olden times of vocal training, there was always
a marked difference made between public and private
singing. So particular were the old masters that they
divided singing into three classes—church singing, stage
singing, and chamber singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Church singing required a more simple manner, a more
pure and severe style, than stage singing; but the voice
like that intended for the stage, had to be strong and full,
with great volume and power, and the intonation clear
and correct. There was not much difference between
the voices of the church and stage singer; that is, it was
not thought that either style injured the voice for the
other, on the contrary, some of the finest voices the
Italian school has produced, have been trained in church
choirs, under the old chapel-masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was always a marked and decided difference
made between stage singing and chamber singing. For
the latter, it is necessary to have a plain, simple manner,
a clear, pure intonation, good articulation, and great
polish. The cadenzas and ornaments should be few, but
of the most exquisite style and finish. Strength and
volume of voice are not so much needed for the chamber
singer, as delicacy of articulation and purity of tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tone, in music as in painting, is mellowed by distance,
and the singer who wishes to produce a pleasing effect in
the drawing-room, should bear this in mind. It is as absurd
to present in private a piece of music executed in the
ornamented, operatic style, as it would be to hang in a
cabinet or drawing-room, a large painting fitted for a
church, a gallery, or a theatre; or, to make another comparison,
for an orator, a public speaker, to entertain the
guests of his drawing-room, with the same loud tone,
earnest rhetorical manner, and volume of voice, that he
used in the public assembly or town-meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The habit of singing in public will give to the private
singer, a manner and style which may sound very well
in the concert-room, or on the stage where they are
mellowed by distance, and softened by an orchestra, but
this same manner and style will appear in private, coarse,
violent, and theatrical. There should be a difference between
public and private singing; both styles are beautiful,
and equally effective in their way, but they should
be kept separate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is well known that actors and actresses, in dressing
for the stage, are apt to lose that nice, delicate eye for
color, which is required to render a private costume
pleasing; they become fond of strong contrasts, bright
colors, and ornaments which appear glaring and wanting
in harmony off the stage. Stage acting also affects the
conversation, the tone of voice, and manner of expression.
We were much amused once with the witty reply of a
clever person, when asked why he did not admire a distinguished
actress he had met with in private.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is too theatrical,” he said. “First she gives us
a dash of tragedy <span class='it'>à la</span> Lady Macbeth, then comes a touch
of genteel comedy <span class='it'>à la</span> Lady Teazle, which is very tiresome.
One likes such exhibitions well enough on the
stage, but they are quite out of place in one’s drawing-room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus it is with vocal music, to make it pleasing in
society, or what is better, in one’s home circle, it should
be like drawing-room, or home costume, home manner,
conversation, reading—simple, pure, with few ornaments,
and those well chosen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though these rules seem severe, they are not confining,
for the chamber-singer is not limited. The music of the
great masters can be produced in private, with great effect,
in the same manner as all of us have, doubtless, heard a
good reader give in private circles, scenes from Shakspeare
and other dramatic poets. If the reader should present
to us in his reading, all the starts, the loud tones and
energetic manner required on the stage to produce an
illusion, his reading would create disgust in us, and we
would listen unwillingly; but if, on the contrary, he should
read in a quiet manner, but with clear enunciation, and
good emphasis, leaving our imaginations and recollections
to make up the stage illusion, then, his reading would
prove effective and pleasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every vocalist knows that the graces and ornaments of
a piece are entirely independent of the melody. The
musical student who has studied the works of the old
composers, will understand this better than the amateur
who has been confined to modern compositions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the olden times more stress was laid upon the simple
melody. Haydn used to say,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let your <span class='it'>air</span> be good, and your composition will be so
likewise, and will assuredly please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the present day, the air is almost forgotten in
the rich <span class='it'>rifioramenti</span>, and bewitching <span class='it'>capricci</span> of the Italian
singer, the surprising <span class='it'>vocalization</span> of the French, and
the graces, shakes, and turns of the English vocalist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not object to these adornments; when properly
used, they produce a pleasing effect—they break up the
monotony of the melody; but any one will see how necessary
it is to have these adornments different in different
places. The graces, cadenzas, etc., which would be
added to a piece sung on the stage, should not be used in
the drawing-room or in the church, although the simple
melody itself, may from its character do very well for
either place, if sung with appropriate ornaments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These elaborate, ornamental, vocal passages, which appear
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>
in modern compositions, are not to be found in the
old writers. They would have considered it derogatory
to the dignity of their melodies, to have written out in
them the <span class='it'>rifioramenti</span> of the singer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We remember seeing, several years ago, some Italian
copies and manuscripts of compositions by Durante, Trajetta,
<a id='pais'></a>Paisiello, and other old Italian masters. They belonged
to a singular, remarkable person, then living in
this country, Signor Trajetta, the son of the old Maestro
Trajetta, the master and companion of Sacchini. These
compositions were for the voice, and in looking over them,
we were struck with their bareness and severity. The
airs were, many of them, pure, and full of beautiful
melody, but we could readily imagine that it would require
a very severe taste to listen to them without finding
them monotonous, and so we said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” replied Trajetta’s pupil, as wild an enthusiast
as his master, “your taste has been spoiled and vitiated
by modern music.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present taste for florid execution was caused, it is
said, by the desire of the vocalists to rival the instrumental
passages of the Opera. During the time of Metastasio,
the musicians, especially those of the German
school, so famous for instrumentation, overpowered the
singers. The struggle of the singers for the lead, caused
Metastasio to make a remark which would apply very
well in this day—that the singers in an Opera made <span class='it'>vocal
concertos</span> of their passages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agujari turned her voice into a flute, and the capricious,
bewitching Gabrielli, the pet pupil of Porpora, astonished
every one by her wonderful <span class='it'>capricci</span> and delicate chromatic
passages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A love for the wonderful displays itself constantly in
mixed audiences, and they are more likely to applaud that
which is surprising, rather than that which is strictly
good. This approbation is apt to dull the taste of the
singer who will forget or neglect good old rules, when by
outraging them, they secure applause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The taste for vocal gracing and adornment has increased
to such a degree that it would be almost impossible to
present a composition of an old master, or even of composers
so late as Mozart, without adding to the adornments
of the original composition. Rossini, whose vocal
compositions in some places appear to consist only of connected
phrases of ornaments and gracings, so completely
is the melody hidden by the <span class='it'>cadenzas</span>, had two styles.
His early style was chaste and simple; his greatest opera,
<span class='it'>Tancredi</span>, was written in this style, and the reader, if
familiar with Rossini’s works, has only to compare this
beautiful opera with one of his last compositions, <span class='it'>Semiramide</span>,
to see the strong contrast between the two styles
of composition. His <span class='it'>L’Italiani in Algeri</span> and <span class='it'>Il Turco
in Italia</span>, operas which contain some of his most exquisite
melodies, belong also to this simple style; but his more
popular operas, <span class='it'>Il Barbiere</span>, <span class='it'>La Cenerentola</span>, <span class='it'>Otello</span>, <span class='it'>La
Gazza Ladra</span>, <span class='it'>etc.</span>, are in his later style, which is florid,
not only in the vocal parts, but also in the orchestral accompaniments;
indeed, he seemed to have attained the
extreme of this florid style, but the composers of the present
time have gone far beyond him; for instance, Verdi,
whose compositions appear to be entirely made up of
<span class='it'>rifioramenti</span>, and while listening with amazement to the
vocal feats his singers perform, in executing his compositions,
a good old-fashioned lover of music is very apt to
wonder if a melody really exists under all these embellishments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is an interesting account given in Stendhal’s Life
of Rossini, relative to his adoption of the florid style in
composition. In 1814 he went to Milan, to superintend
the bringing out of his opera, <span class='it'>L’Aureliano in Palmiro</span>.
The principal tenore, Velluti, a very handsome man, had a
voice of great flexibility. At the first rehearsal, Velluti
sung his part in a manner that delighted the composer; at
the second rehearsal, the singer added some cadenzas,
which Rossini applauded even rapturously; at the third
rehearsal, the original melodies of some of the cavatinas
seemed lost amid the luxurious profusion of vocal ornaments;
but at the first public representation of the opera
the singer added so many <span class='it'>fiorituri</span>, that Rossini exclaimed,
“<span class='it'>Non conosco più la mia musica!</span>”<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a>; however, Velluti’s
singing was well received by the audience, and every vocal
feat brought down thunders of applause. The hint was
not lost on Rossini. He observed that his opera had but
little success without Velluti, and he resolved in future
to compose in a different style. He would no longer remain
at the mercy of the singer, but write down in his
score a sufficient number of embellishments, not leaving
room for the addition of a single <span class='it'>appogiatura</span> by the
singer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have digressed from the original subject, dear
reader, in order to show that the <span class='it'>rifioramenti</span> of a piece
are mere additions, and also to point out to the amateur
the propriety of omitting startling and surprising stage
points, when presenting in private fine operatic passages,
and the nice, delicate taste that would be displayed in
giving more of the original melody, avoiding embellishments,
using them only where they seem absolutely necessary
to break up the monotony of a continuous strain, and
render it more effective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We could give our other objection to this public singing
of amateurs, which objection applies more particularly to
lady amateurs; but we have chatted long enough already,
and, moreover, our objection is decidedly too old-fashioned
to be talked about in these days, “of rights of men, women
and children;” therefore, we will suffer it to pass
unmentioned, trusting to the force of the one already given
to convince you, at least good reader.</p>

describes the picture as fully justifying the high opinion
formed of the young artist’s genius, and as placing his
name in the front rank of our American artists. The picture
represents a young soldier just returned from Mexico,
travel-stained and wounded; he sits at a table relating his
adventures to his grandfather, “Old ’76,” while his father
and mother, and a group of colored servants, peeping in at
the door, are eagerly listening to the soldier’s rehearsal of
his battles. All the accessories of the picture are purely
American, and help to carry out the story; the portrait of
the old man, painted in all his rosy prime, the bust of
Washington, the ornaments on the mantle, all are in strict
keeping; but it is in the individualities of character as
delineated in the countenances and actions of the different
personages that the genius of the artist is displayed; the
old man, leaning on his crutch, shaking his head with a
mixed feeling of pride in his grandson’s achievements, and
a recollection of his own acts in the times that tried men’s
souls, is a triumph of the artist; the old fellow seems to
be just at the point of saying “O yes, my boy, all that
is very well; you fought bravely, no doubt, and General
Taylor was a good soldier; but it’s nothing to old ’76,
and General Taylor ain’t Washington.” It is a most successful

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Elementary Sketches of Moral Philosophy: Delivered at
the Royal Institution, in the years 1804, 1805 and 1806:
By the late Rev. Sidney Smith, M. A. New York:
Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sidney Smith appears, in this volume, as an ethical and
metaphysical philosopher, and certainly ethics and metaphysics
were never before made so clear and so entertaining.
Sharp, shrewd, sensible, witty, humorous, eloquent,
discriminating, the author goes on, from topic to topic,
analyzing and laughing, condensing maxims into epigrams,
embodying principles in sarcasms, eliciting jokes
from abstractions; and after making his reader laugh tears
into his eyes and pains into his sides, really leaves him in
possession of more metaphysical knowledge than he would
get from Dugald Stewart. The mind of Sidney Smith
was so beautiful and brilliant, that men have done injustice
to its depth and exactness. He was really an accomplished
belles-lettres scholar, a close reasoner, a proficient
in the philosophy of politics, morals and mind, as well as
a wit and humorist; and in one of the rarest gifts of reason,
justness and readiness in the conception of premises,
he evinced equal force and fertility. Besides all this, he
was an honest, courageous, uncanting, and disinterested
man—loving and possessing goodness and virtue, hating
and denouncing wickedness and vice. His goodness had
not the weak diffusion which characterises the quality in
the so-called “good people;” but will and intellect condensed
it into lightning, and launched it at error and evil.
It smiles sweetly, but it also smites sharply; and no man
is more worthy of contemptuous pity than the bigot,
dunce, libertine, professional rascal or knavish politician,
who comes within word-shot of Sidney’s indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no part of the present book which will not delight
and instruct the general reader; but the most original
portions are those devoted to practical remarks on
mental diseases and to acute observations on minor topics
of the great subject. To all who know Sidney Smith’s
writings it is needless to add, that every idea in the volume
is conceived and stated clearly, and that the author’s
ignorance in the higher regions of his theme never seeks
refuge in obscure terms, but is boldly, and some times exultingly,
acknowledged. Many of the great philosophers,
and especially the idealists and skeptics, are rather fleeringly
disposed of. Common sense is Sydney’s test; but
common sense is hardly able to grapple with Aristotle and
Descartes, the greatest of metaphysicians; and they are,
therefore, praised for their power and ridiculed for its
perversion. The author’s peculiar felicity in making ludicrous
statements which operate with the force of arguments,
is displayed throughout the volume. “Bishop
Berkeley,” he says, “destroyed this world in one volume
octavo, and nothing remained after his time but mind;
which experienced a similar fate from the hand of Mr.
Hume, in 1737.” Nothing could be more felicitous than
this statement, considered as a practical argument against
the systems of the idealists and skeptics. Again he says:
“A great philosopher may sit in his study, and deny the
existence of matter; but if he take a walk into the streets
he must take care to leave his theory behind him. Pyrrho
said there was no such thing as pain; and he saw no <span class='it'>proof</span>
that there were such things as carts and wagons; and he
refused to get out of their way: but Pyrrho had, fortunately
for him, three or four stout slaves, who followed
their master without following his doctrine; and whenever
they saw one of these ideal machines approaching,
took him up by the arms and legs, and, without attempting
to controvert his arguments, put him down in a place
of safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passages on Aristotle are in a similar vein of pleasantry.
“Some writers,” he remarks, “say he was a
Jew; others that he got all his information from a Jew,
that he kept an apothecary’s shop, and was an Atheist;
others say, on the contrary, that he did not keep an apothecary’s
shop and that he was a Trinitarian.” Further
on he adds, that Aristotle’s philosophy “had an exclusive
monopoly granted to it by the Parliament of Paris, <span class='it'>who
forbad the use of any other in France</span>;” and he goes on to
compare the great Stagarite with Bacon, to the manifest
disadvantage of the former. After speaking of the triumphs
of the Baconian method, and the indebtedness of
mankind to the vast understanding of its author, he proceeds
to remark, that to “the understanding of Aristotle,
equally vast, perhaps, and equally original, we are indebted
for fifteen hundred years of quibbling and ignorance;
in which the earth fell under the tyranny of words,
and philosophers quarreled with one another, like drunken
men in dark rooms, <span class='it'>who hate peace without knowing why
they fight, or seeing how to take aim</span>.” Zeno, the founder
of the sect of the Stoics, is represented as a Cyprus merchant,
who had studied the writings of the most eminent
Socratic philosophers, and who, in the course of his mercantile
pursuits, “freighted a ship for Athens, with a very
valuable cargo of Phœnician purple, which he completely
lost by shipwreck, on the coast near the <a id='pir'></a>Piræus. A very
acute man, who found himself in a state of sudden and
complete poverty in Athens, would naturally enough
think of turning philosopher, both as by its doctrines it
inspired him with some consolation for the loss of his
Phœnician purple, and by its profits afforded him some
chance of subsistence without it.” Socrates, he says,
was the great father and inventor of common sense, “as
Ceres was of the plough and Bacchus of intoxication.”
Two thousand years ago, he adds, “common sense was
not invented. If Orpheus, or Linus, or any of those melodious
moralists, sung, in bad verses, such advice as a
grand-mamma would now give to a child of six years old,
he was thought to be inspired by the gods, and statues and
altars were erected to his memory. In Hesiod there is a
very grave exhortation to mankind to wash their faces;
and I have discovered a very strong analogy between the
precepts of Pythagoras and Mrs. Trimmer—both think
that a son ought to obey his father, and both are clear that
a good man is better than a bad one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the best lectures of the volume, both for sense
and brilliancy, are those on the “Conduct of the Understanding,”
the “Faculties of Animals and Men,” “Habit,”
and “Wit and Humor.” In these Sydney Smith exhibits
both his power of rapid analysis and his power of
clearly perceiving the essential points of the subjects he
discusses. The lecture on the “Faculties of Animals and
Men,” is a sort of humorous philosophical poem in prose,
the beauty of the humor being as striking as its laughable
quality. He commences with observing that he would do
no injustice to the poor brutes, especially as they have
“no professors to revenge their cause by lecturing on our
faculties;” and he is so perfectly satisfied with the superiority
of men to animals, that he sees no reason why he
should not give the latter full credit for what “few fragments
of soul and tatters of understanding they may really
possess.” His settled opinion is, that baboons and blue
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
apes will never rival mankind in understanding or imagination,
though he confesses that he has sometimes felt a
little uneasy at Exeter ’change, “from contrasting the
monkeys with the ’prentice boys who are teasing them;”
but a few pages of Locke, or a few lines of Milton, always
restored him to his tranquil belief in the superiority of
man. He then proceeds to give a humorous statement of
the various opinions held by philosophers on the physiology
of brutes, emphasising especially the theory of Père
Bougeant, a Jesuit, that each animal is animated by a separate
and distinct devil; “that not only this was the
case with respect to cats, which have long been known to
be very favorite residences of familiar spirits, but that a
particular devil swam with every turbot, grazed with
every ox, soared with every lark, dived with every duck,
and was roasted with every chicken.” Smith then goes
on to define and illustrate instinct, with an analysis as fine
as the humor is exquisite. Instinct he considers as an animal’s
unconscious use of means which are subservient to
an end, in contradistinction to reason, which is a conscious
use of those means and a perception of their relation to
the end. The examples are all stated in Smith’s peculiar
manner. It would take, he says, “a senior wrangler at
Cambridge ten hours a day, for three years together, to
know enough mathematics for the calculation of these
problems, with which not only every queen bee, but every
<span class='it'>under-graduate grub</span>, is acquainted the moment it is born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general conclusion of Smith, with regard to insects
and animals, is the common one, that their instincts and
faculties all relate to this world, and that they have, properly
speaking, no souls to be saved. But this position he
states, illustrates and defends with more than ordinary
metaphysical acuteness. If the discussion were not so
sparklingly conducted, it would strike the reader as very
able analysis and reasoning; but the mirthful fancy with
which the whole is adorned, satisfies of itself, and seems
to claim no additional praise for the argument it illustrates.
The delicious sympathy of the humorist for all
grades of being peeps out on every page, and no insect or
animal is referred to without being lifted into the comic
ideal. Thus he remarks that nature seems on some animals
to have bestowed vast attention, “<span class='it'>and to have
sketched out others in a moment, and turned them adrift</span>.
The house-fly skims about, perches upon a window or a
nose, breakfasts and sups with you, lays his eggs upon
your white cotton stockings, runs into the first hole in the
wall when it is cold, and perishes with as much unconcern
as he lives.” Again, in speaking of that superiority of
man over animals which comes from his longevity, he remarks:
“I think it is Helvetius who says he is quite certain
we only owe our superiority over the ourang-outangs
to the greater length of life conceded to us; and that, if
our life had been as short as theirs, they would have totally
defeated us in the competition for nuts and ripe
blackberries. I can hardly agree to this extravagant
statement; but I think in a life of twenty years the efforts
of the human mind would have been so considerably lowered,
that we might probably have thought Helvetius a
good philosopher, and admired his skeptical absurdities
as some of the greatest efforts of the human understanding.
Sir Richard Blackmore would have been our greatest
poet, our wit would have been Dutch, our faith French,
the Hottentots would have given us the model for manners,
and the Turks for government.” He then adds that
man’s gregarious nature is another cause of his superiority
over all other animals. “A lion lies under a hole in
the rock, and if any other lion happen to pass by they
fight. Now, whoever gets a habit of lying under a hole
in a rock, and fighting with every gentleman who passes
near him, cannot possibly make any progress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lecture on “Wit and Humor” is, perhaps, the most
brilliant of all; but, though the definitions are keenly
stated and the distinctions nicely drawn, we suppose that
even Sidney Smith, fine wit and humorist as he is, has not
settled the matter. It appears to us that the difficulty
consists in considering wit and humor as distinct powers,
instead of viewing them as modifications of other powers.
The mental peculiarities which distinguish wit and humor
are qualities equally of fancy and imagination. The
difference is emotional, not intellectual; in sentiment, not
in faculty. A man whose sentiment and feeling of the
ludicrous is predominant, will naturally make his intellectual
powers serve his mirthful tendencies. If he has
a lively fancy he will be a wit; if he has a creative imagination
he will be a humorist. We should say, generally,
that wit was fancy and understanding, directed by the
sentiment of mirth; and that humor was imagination and
understanding, directed by the same sentiment. It will be
found, we think, in all ingenious and creative minds, that
their peculiar direction depends altogether on sentiment.
Sometimes imagination is exercised in a department of
thought or action so far removed from the fine arts, that
we can hardly recognize the power in its direction. In
metaphysics, in mathematics, in government, war and
commerce, we often come in contact with thinkers of vast
imaginations, who still may despise poets and artists, and
be heartily despised by them. If a change in the form and
purpose of imagination thus appears, to many minds, to
change its qualities, and to demand new definitions, we
need not wonder at the popular reluctance to admit wits
and humorists into the band of poets, though fancy and
imagination be equally their characteristics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although our notice of this delightful volume has extended
beyond the space we can properly allow it, we
take leave of its wise and witty pages with regret,
heartily commending it to the leisure hours of every man
who can relish vivid argument and brilliant good sense.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Confessions of an English Opium Eater, and Suspiria de
Profundis. By Thomas De Quincy, Boston: Wm.
D. Ticknor &amp; Co. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thomas de Quincy has been well known during the
last twenty years, not only as the author of “Confessions
of an English Opium Eater”, but as a prominent contributor
of able, thoughtful, and eloquent articles to Blackwood’s
Magazine, and other British periodicals. The publishers
of the present volume intend to follow it up with
others, containing the best of his many remarkable historical,
biographical, and critical papers. When completed,
the series will constitute a body of thought which no student’s
library can well be without, for the author’s learning
extends over widely separated departments of literature and
science, and in each he has proved himself capable of
throwing out those suggestive thoughts which take root
in the reader’s mind, and bear fruit. A resolute, inquisitive,
and reflective student, richly dowered with understanding
and imagination, and exercising great dominion
over the harmonies and subtilties of expression, De Quincy
has been prevented from producing little more than colossal
fragments of thought, by the mastery obtained over his
will by opium, and the contemptuousness of disposition
which that habit provokes for calm, orderly, systematic
works. He is dogmatic, negatively as well as positively.
It is natural that a man who obtains glimpses of grand
truths and magnificent systems, through artificial stimulants,
should disdain the sober realizations of consecutive
and industrious thought, wanting all that misty magnificence
which clothes things viewed in the waking dreams
of the opium eater. But egotist and dogmatist as he is, he
is still a resolute thinker, whose mind, busy with all the
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
problems of society and philosophy, is continually startling
us with novel thoughts and splendid rhetoric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first part of the “Confessions” there is one passage,
describing a dream inspired by opium, which we
cannot resist the temptation to extract, as it is one of the
sublimest in English prose. “The dream,” he says,
“commenced with a music which now I often heard in
dreams—a music of preparation and awakening suspense;
a music like the opening of the Coronation Anthem, and
which, like <span class='it'>that</span>, gave the feeling of a vast march, of infinite
cavalcades filing off, and the tread of innumerable
armies. The morning was come of a mighty day—a day
of crisis and of final hope for human nature, then suffering
some mysterious eclipse, and laboring in some dread extremity.
Somewhere, I knew not where—somehow, I
knew not how—by some beings, I knew not whom—a
battle, a strife, an agony, was conducting—was evolved,
like a great drama, or piece of music; with which my
sympathy was the more insupportable from my confusion
as to its place, its cause, its nature, and its possible issue.
I, as is usual in dreams, (where we make ourselves central
to every movement,) had the power, and yet had not
the power, to decide it. I had the power, if I could raise
myself, to will it; and yet again had not the power, for the
weight of twenty Atlantics was upon me, or the oppression
of inexpiable guilt. ‘Deeper than ever plummet
sounded,’ I lay inactive. Then, like a chorus, the passion
deepened. Some greater interest was at stake; some
mightier cause than ever yet the sword had pleaded, or
trumpet had proclaimed. Then came sudden alarms;
hurryings to and fro; trepidations of innumerable fugitives.
I knew not whether from the good cause or the
bad, darkness and light, tempest and human faces, and at
last with the sense that all was lost, female forms, and
the features that were worth all the world to me, and but
a moment allowed—and clasped hands, and heart-breaking
partings, and then—everlasting farewells! and, with a
sigh such as the caves of hell sighed when the incestuous
mother uttered the abhorred name of death, the sound was
reverberated—everlasting farewells! and again, and yet
again reverberated—everlasting farewells!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suspiria de Profundis,” the conclusion of the Confessions,
occupies about as much space as the original
work, and has now, for the first time, been connected with
it in the same volume. The style of the conclusion is even
more majestic, visionary and resounding than the first
portion, and is full of thrilling pictures and Macbeth
“sights.” We hope that this volume will meet with a
success so marked, as to induce the publishers to issue
the remaining volumes of De Quincey’s miscellanies in
rapid succession.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Life and Letters of Thomas Campbell, Edited by William
Beattie; M. D., one of his Executors, New York:
Harper &amp; Brothers, 2 vols. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Beattie’s work cannot take a high place in biographical
literature, as far as it is to be judged by his own
power of thinking and writing. He has, properly speaking,
no conception of Campbell’s character; and the passage
from one of his statements to the letter or anecdote
which he adduces in its support, will indicate this to the
least reflecting reader. Were it not for the richness of
his materials his work would not be worth reprinting;
but it has great value and interest from the number and
variety of the private letters it contains. Campbell’s correspondence,
though it evinces much nervous weakness
of mind and a sensitiveness of vanity easily elated or depressed,
has a peculiar raciness which wins and rewards
attention; and, in addition to its own excellent qualities
of wit and fancy, which delight of <a id='them'></a>themselves, it furnishes
much information relating to the literary men of the last
fifty years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Irving has written a very pleasing introduction
to these volumes, characteristic equally of his delicacy,
his good nature and his discrimination, and embodying
several new anecdotes of Campbell. He says
that Beattie’s life “lays open the springs of all his actions
and the causes of all his contrariety of conduct. We
now see the real difficulties he had to contend with in the
earlier part of his literary career; the worldly cares
which pulled his spirit to the earth whenever it would
wing its way to the skies; the domestic affections, tugging
at his heart-strings even in his hours of genial intercourse,
and <span class='it'>converting his very smiles into spasms</span>; the
anxious days and sleepless nights preying upon his delicate
organization, producing that morbid sensibility and
nervous irritability which at times overlaid the real
sweetness and amenity of his nature, and obscured the
unbounded generosity of his heart.” This praise, of
course, must be considered due to the “Letters” rather
than the “Life” of Campbell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Jeffrey, in a letter to Campbell, on the subject of
“Gertrude of Wyoming,” very felicitously indicates the
prominent faults of that exquisite poem, and of Campbell’s
general artistic method. “The most dangerous
faults,” he says, “are your faults of diction. There is a
good deal of obscurity in many passages—in others a
strained and unnatural expression—an appearance of labor
and hardness; you have hammered the metal in some
places till it had lost all its ductility. These are not
great faults, but they are blemishes; and as dunces will
find them out—noodles will see them when they are pointed
to. I wish you had courage to correct, or rather to avoid
them, for with you they are faults of over-finishing, and
not of negligence. I have another fault to charge you
with in private—for which I am more angry with you than
for all the rest. Your timidity, or fastidiousness, or some
other knavish quality, will not let you give your conceptions
glowing, and bold, and powerful, as they present
themselves, but you must chasten, and refine, and soften
them, forsooth, till half their nature and grandeur is chiseled
away from them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An interesting feature in this biography is the number
of poems it contains not included in any edition of Campbell’s
works, and the original drafts it gives of many of
Campbell’s well-known productions. The “Battle of the
Baltic” originally contained twenty-seven stanzas, and in
that shape was enclosed in a letter to Scott. We extract
a specimen of the omitted verses:</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Life of Campbell, and the Life of Southey, now in
course of publication by the same house, are the best
literary biographies we have had since The Life of Mackintosh,
edited by his Son. We wish the Harpers would
reprint the latter, as there has been no complete American
edition of it ever published. It contains more matter than
any similar work since Moore’s Life of Byron.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The National Cook Book. By a Lady of Philadelphia, a
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
Practical Housewife. Philada.: Robert E. Peterson.
1 vol. 12 mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is, on all sides, admitted to be the very best of the
many cook books that have been issued by the press of late
years. The editor, be she whom she may, understands
the art of preparing a delicious meal, of any material, it
seems, and our taste has passed favorable judgment upon a
fruit cake of most inviting look, and of quality the best. A
lady, in whose judgment we have the most unbounded
confidence, pronounces this “the only cook book worthy
of a housekeeper’s perusal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to the intellectual feast, which is spread before the
reader of Graham each month, we suppose, will come a
snug breakfast, a glorious good dinner, or a cozy, palate-inviting
supper of birds, with mushrooms. Now, without
Peterson’s Cook Book, the meal cannot be perfection. Of
this we feel convinced.</p>

Brady. Engraved by D’Avignon. Edited by C. Edwards
Lester, assisted by an Association of Literary
men. 205 Broadway, New York.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We have received the sixth number of this truly national
work—the first and second we have before this
noticed. The third, fourth and fifth numbers the publishers
have omitted to send us. As we have before
stated, this is a publication of great merit, and cannot fail
to attract a liberal encouragement both in this country
and abroad. The portraits are executed with wonderful
fidelity, and are the best specimens of the lithographic art
we have ever seen. Mr. Brady deserves much praise for
his exact and skillful daguerreotypes, from which D’Avignon
has produced these masterly “counterfeit presentments”
of our great national characters. The selection
from our living worthies have been well made. The publishers
have not confined themselves to the faces of our
elder public men long familiar in the print shops, but they
have well chosen alike from the old and the young—those
who have been long famous by past services, and those
whose genius and precocious merit have excited a keen interest
and a just pride in the heart of every American. This
number is adorned by a life-like portrait of Col. Fremont;
and the editor, Mr. Lester, has in this, as he has in those
numbers which have preceded it, and which have been
sent to us, given a brief and pointed sketch of the marvelous
youth whose adventures in the camp of science outstrips
the wildest tales of romantic daring. A work like
this must prosper.</p>

D. D., Bishop of the Diocese of Vermont. New
York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Hopkins is already well known as an Episcopalian
writer of much merit and erudition, and the present work
will add considerably to his reputation. It is acute,
learned, and clear, going patiently over the whole historical
ground of the dispute between the Church of England
and the Church of Rome, and singularly candid and
dispassionate in its tone and in its substance. We rarely
see, in a controversialist, such decided opinions, in connection
with so much intellectual conscientiousness.</p>

New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 1 vol. 12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This volume is evidently the production of some individual
whose ambition to write a book was far greater
than his ability to write a good one; the result is a compilation
from Boswell’s Life of Johnson, made up from
its most valueless and uninteresting portions, without the
addition of any thing of importance by the compiler. Dr.
Johnson, in his own time, had no power of communicating
any of his own intellectual or moral life to his mental
sycophants; and, judging from the present volume, we
should suppose that this power was still wanting in his
writings.</p>

Spain and Morocco, in 1848. By David Urquhart, Esq.,
M. P. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers. 2 vols.
12mo.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the volumes of travels lately issued, this appears
to us the most independent and intelligent. The author
gives a new view of the social condition of Spain, and
states some facts and opinions calculated to make us
re-examine the notions commonly held of Spanish affairs.
He is an acute observer of men, a scholar, a politician
versed in the practical details of legislation and government,
and a man who sees, feels, and thinks for himself.
To those who have read Barrow and Ford the work will
have great attractions.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Edgar A. Poe.</span>—We have on hand several articles,
from leading writers of the country, upon the life and
character of Edgar A. Poe, which we will find room for
in the December number, in which we shall give an extra
form, for the purpose of putting before the country these
generous tributes to the dead poet and critic. The causticity
of several of them will not be particularly relished
by his immaculate defamers, who busy themselves in
raking up his ashes to expose his defects to the gaze of
the world.</p>

<hr class='tbk140'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>A Deserved Honor.</span>—We see that at the late commencement
of the Miami University, Ohio, the degree of
LL. D. was conferred upon Professor John S. Hart, of
the Philadelphia High School. It is a compliment very
properly bestowed, and from an Institution which renders
the honor of value.</p>

<hr class='tbk141'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Last Chance.</span>—We desire to impress upon the attention
of the subscribers to “Graham,” that if they desire
our elegant Premium Plates, they should now remit either
$3 for one year, or $5 for two years, or for two copies one
year. In either case we furnish each subscriber <span class='it'>thus sent</span>,
“<span class='it'>Christ Blessing Little Children</span>,” and “<span class='it'>The First
Prayer</span>”—two beautiful engravings of large size.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>After the first of November</span>, the plate will be disposed
of, and no premiums will thereafter be sent from this
office.</p>

<hr class='tbk142'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Our Paris Fashions.</span>—Every mail brings us congratulations
upon the superior finish and beauty of our
Paris Fashion Plates. Our friends have opened their eyes
to the fact, that “Graham” is the only magazine in America
that incurs the expense of <span class='it'>original</span> designs. All others
are copies of the French plates, poorly done, and insufferably
old. We should not mention the matter, but that
efforts are made to deceive the magazine public by silly
and unfounded boasting. The expense, which is several
hundred dollars <span class='it'>extra</span> each month, we cheerfully incur for
the liberal subscribers to this magazine, whose cultivated
taste would soon detect the bold impositions practiced
upon others.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
